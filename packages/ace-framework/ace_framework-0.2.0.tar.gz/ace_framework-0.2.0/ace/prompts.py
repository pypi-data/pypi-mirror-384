Prompt templates for ACE roles - fully customizable for your use case.

These default prompts are adapted from the ACE paper. You can customize them
to better suit your specific task by providing your own templates when
initializing the Generator, Reflector, and Curator.

Customization Example:
    >>> from ace import Generator
    >>> from ace.llm_providers import LiteLLMClient
    >>>
    >>> # Custom generator prompt for code tasks
    >>> code_generator_prompt = '''
    ... You are a senior developer. Use the playbook to write clean code.
    ...
    ... Playbook: {playbook}
    ... Reflection: {reflection}
    ... Task: {question}
    ... Requirements: {context}
    ...
    ... Return JSON with:
    ... - reasoning: Your approach
    ... - bullet_ids: Applied strategies
    ... - final_answer: The code solution
    ... '''
    >>>
    >>> client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4")
    >>> generator = Generator(client, prompt_template=code_generator_prompt)

Prompt Variables:
    Generator:
        - {playbook}: Current playbook strategies
        - {reflection}: Recent reflection context
        - {question}: The question/task to solve
        - {context}: Additional requirements or context

    Reflector:
        - {question}: Original question
        - {reasoning}: Generator's reasoning
        - {prediction}: Generator's answer
        - {ground_truth}: Correct answer if available
        - {feedback}: Environment feedback
        - {playbook_excerpt}: Relevant playbook bullets used

    Curator:
        - {progress}: Training progress summary
        - {stats}: Playbook statistics
        - {reflection}: Latest reflection analysis
        - {playbook}: Current full playbook
        - {question_context}: Question and feedback context

Tips for Custom Prompts:
    1. Keep JSON output format consistent
    2. Be specific about your domain (math, code, writing, etc.)
    3. Add task-specific instructions and constraints
    4. Test with your actual use cases
    5. Iterate based on the quality of generated strategies

Additional context:

Respond with a compact JSON object:

Use the playbook, model reasoning, and feedback to identify mistakes and actionable insights.
Output must be a single valid JSON object. Do NOT include analysis text or explanations outside the JSON.
Begin the response with `{{` and end with `}}`.

Question:
