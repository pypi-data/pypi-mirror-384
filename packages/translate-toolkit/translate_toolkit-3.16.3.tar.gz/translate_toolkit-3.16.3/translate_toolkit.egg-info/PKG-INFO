The Translate Toolkit is a set of software and documentation designed to help
make the lives of localizers both more productive and less frustrating.  The
Toolkit is part of the Translate project, hosted at
<https://github.com/translate>.

The software includes programs to convert localization formats to the common
PO, and emerging XLIFF format.  There are also programs to check and manage PO
and XLIFF files.  Online documentation includes guides on using the tools,
running a localization project and how to localize various projects from
OpenOffice.org to Mozilla.

At its core the software contains a set of classes for handling various
localization storage formats: DTD, properties, OpenOffice.org GSI/SDF,
CSV, MO, Qt .ts, TMX, TBX, WordFast txt, Gettext .mo, Windows RC, and
of course PO and XLIFF.  It also provides scripts to convert between
these formats.

Also part of the Toolkit are Python programs to create word counts, merge
translations and perform various checks on translation files.

Joining the Translate Project
-----------------------------
If you would like to join the translate project mailing list then visit:
<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translate-devel>.

The vision of the Translate Project is to be a meta project for localizers
built on the premise that your language deserves to be a project on its own
right not a poor cousin of the main project.

Most projects are inattentive to the needs and difficulties experienced by
localizers. To that end the aim is to work towards creating tools and
documentation that allows localizers to focus on what they do best: translating
software.

Requirements
------------

There are several extra requirements which you might to install to get full
feature set. This cal be easily specified during pip installation::

    # Install with XML support
    pip install translate-toolkit[XML]

    # Install all optional dependencies
    pip install translate-toolkit[all]

.. note:: Please check ``pyproject.toml``

The Toolkit requires Python 3.9 or newer.

The package lxml is required. You should install version 4.6.3 or later.
<http://lxml.de/> Depending on your platform, the easiest way to install might
be through your system's package management. Alternatively you can try ::

    pip install lxml

which should install the newest version from the web.

For Mac OSX, the following pages might be of help:
<http://lxml.de/build.html#building-lxml-on-macos-x>
<http://lxml.de/installation.html#macos-x>

The package lxml has dependencies on libxml2 and libxslt. Please check the lxml
site for the recommended versions of these libraries if you need to install
them separately at all. Most packaged versions of lxml will already contain
these dependencies.

When the environment variable USECPO is set to 1, the toolkit will attempt to
use libgettextpo from the gettext-tools package (it might have a slightly
different name on your distribution). This can greatly speed up access to PO
files, but has not yet been tested as extensively. Feedback is most welcome.

The package iniparse is necessary for ini2po and po2ini:
<https://pypi.org/project/iniparse/>

The python-Levenshtein package will improve performance for fuzzy matching if
it is available. This can improve the performance of pot2po, for example.  It
is optional and no functionality is lost if it is not installed, only speed.
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/translate/files/python-Levenshtein/>

Functions in the `lang.data` module can supply functions to translate language
names using the `pycountry` package. It can even translate names in the format
``Language (Country)`` such as ``English (South Africa)`` This is used by
Pootle and Virtaal. If the package is not installed, the language names will
simply appear in English. It is therefore recommended you install the
`pycountry` package.

The package vobject is needed for ical2po and po2ical.

The aeidon package is needed for sub2po
and po2sub. Some Unicode encoded files (including most files from
<http://dotsub.com/>) require version 0.14 or later.

Trados TXT TM support requires the BeautifulSoup parser
<http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>

Markdown support requires the mistletoe parser
