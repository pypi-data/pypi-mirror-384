[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/edges.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/csc-brightway)

``edges`` is a library allowing flexible Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) 
for the ``brightway2``/``brightway25`` LCA framework.

Unlike traditional LCIA methods that apply characterization factors (CFs) solely to `nodes` 
(e.g., elementary flows), `edges` applies CFs directly on the edges — the exchanges between 
suppliers and consumers — allowing for more precise and context-sensitive impact characterization.

This approach enables LCIA factors to reflect the specific context of each exchange, including parameters such as:

* Geographic region of production and consumption 
* Magnitude of flows 
* Scenario-based parameters (e.g., changing atmospheric conditions)

The ``edges`` Python library offers a novel approach to applying characterization factors 
(CFs) during the impact assessment phase of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). 
Unlike conventional methods that uniformly assign CFs to *nodes* (e.g., processes 
like ``Water, from well`` in the brightway2 ecosystem), ``edges`` shifts the focus to the 
*edges*—the *exchanges* or relationships between *nodes*. This allows CFs to be conditioned 
based on the specific context of each *exchange*. Essentially, ``edges`` introduces unique 
values in the characterization matrix tailored to the characteristics of each *edge*.

By focusing on *edges*, the library incorporates contextual information such as the 
attributes of both the *supplier* and the *consumer* (e.g., geographic location, ISIC 
classification, amount exchanged, etc.). This enables a more detailed and flexible 
impact characterization, accommodating parameters like the location of the consumer 
and the magnitude of the exchange.

Furthermore, ``edges`` supports the calculation of weighted CFs for both static regions 
(e.g., RER) and dynamic regions (e.g., RoW), enhancing its ability to model complex 
and region-specific scenarios.

## Key Features

* Edge-based CFs: Assign CFs specifically to individual exchanges between processes. 
* Geographic resolution: Supports 346 national and sub-national regions. 
* Scenario-based flexibility: Incorporate parameters (e.g., CO₂ atmospheric concentration) directly in CF calculations, enabling dynamic scenario analysis. 
* Efficient workflow: Clearly separates expensive exchange-mapping tasks (performed once) from inexpensive scenario-based numeric CF evaluations.

Currently, the library provides regionalized CFs for:

* AWARE 2.0 (water scarcity impacts)
* ImpactWorld+ 2.1
* GeoPolRisk 1.0
* GLAM3 Land use impacts on biodiversity

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install edges
```

> [!NOTE]
> The library is compatible with both `brightway2` and `brightway25`.
> Please ensure you have one of these frameworks installed in your Python environment.

## Getting Started

Check out the [examples' notebook](https://github.com/romainsacchi/edges/blob/main/examples/examples.ipynb).

### Check available methods from ``edges``

```python
    
from edges import get_available_methods

# Get the available methods
methods = get_available_methods()
print(methods)

```

### Perform edge-based LCIA with ``edges``

```python
import bw2data
from edges import EdgeLCIA

# Select an activity from the LCA database
act = bw2data.Database("ecoinvent-3.10-cutoff").random()

# Define a method
method = ('AWARE 1.2c', 'Country', 'unspecified', 'yearly')

# Initialize the LCA object
LCA = EdgeLCIA({act: 1}, method)
LCA.lci()

# Map CFs to exchanges: apply suggested strategies
LCA.apply_strategies()

# or apply these strategies manually
#LCA.map_exchanges()

# If needed, extend the mapping to aggregated and `dynamic` regions (e.g., RoW)
#LCA.map_aggregate_locations()
#LCA.map_dynamic_locations()
#LCA.map_contained_locations()

# add global CFs to exchanges missing a CF
#LCA.map_remaining_locations_to_global()

# Evaluate CFs
LCA.evaluate_cfs()

# Perform the LCIA calculation
LCA.lcia()
print(LCA.score)

# Print a dataframe with the characterization factors used
LCA.generate_cf_table()

```

### Perform parameter-based LCIA

Consider the following LCIA data file (saved under `gwp_example.json`)`:

```json
{
  "name": "Example LCIA Method",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Example LCIA method for greenhouse gas emissions",
    "unit": "kg CO2e",
    "exchanges": [
      {
        "supplier": {
          "name": "Carbon dioxide",
          "operator": "startswith",
          "matrix": "biosphere"
        },
        "consumer": {
          "matrix": "technosphere",
          "type": "process"
        },
        "value": "1.0"
      },
      {
        "supplier": {
          "name": "Methane, fossil",
          "operator": "contains",
          "matrix": "biosphere"
        },
        "consumer": {
          "matrix": "technosphere",
          "type": "process"
        },
        "value": "28 * (1 + 0.001 * (co2ppm - 410))"
      },
      {
        "supplier": {
          "name": "Dinitrogen monoxide",
          "operator": "equals",
          "matrix": "biosphere"
        },
        "consumer": {
          "matrix": "technosphere",
          "type": "process"
        },
        "value": "265 * (1 + 0.0005 * (co2ppm - 410))"
      }
  ]
}

```

We can perform a parameter-based LCIA calculation as follows:

```python


import bw2data
from edges import EdgeLCIA

# Select an activity from the LCA database
bw2data.projects.set_current("ecoinvent-3.10.1-cutoff")
act = bw2data.Database("ecoinvent-3.10.1-cutoff").random()
print(act)

# Define scenario parameters (e.g., atmospheric CO₂ concentration and time horizon)
params = {
    "some scenario": {
         "co2ppm": {"2020": 410, "2050": 450, "2100": 500}, "h": {"2020": 100, "2050": 100, "2100": 100}
    }
}

# Define an LCIA method (symbolic CF expressions stored in JSON)
method = ('GWP', 'scenario-dependent', '100 years')

# Initialize LCIA
lcia = EdgeLCIA(
   demand={act: 1},
   filepath="lcia_example_3.json",
   parameters=params
)

# Perform inventory calculations (once)
lcia.lci()

# Map exchanges to CF entries (once)
lcia.map_exchanges()

# Optionally, resolve geographic overlaps and disaggregations (once)
lcia.map_aggregate_locations()
lcia.map_dynamic_locations()
lcia.map_remaining_locations_to_global()

# Run scenarios efficiently
results = []
for idx in {"2020", "2050", "2100"}:
    lcia.evaluate_cfs(idx)
    lcia.lcia()
    df = lcia.generate_cf_table()

    scenario_result = {
        "scenario": idx,
        "co2ppm": params["some scenario"]["co2ppm"][idx],
        "score": lcia.score,
        "CF_table": df
    }
    results.append(scenario_result)

    print(f"Scenario (CO₂ {params['some scenario']['co2ppm'][idx]} ppm): Impact = {lcia.score}")

```
