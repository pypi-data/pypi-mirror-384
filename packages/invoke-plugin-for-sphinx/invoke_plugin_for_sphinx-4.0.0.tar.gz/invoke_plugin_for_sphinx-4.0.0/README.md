# Invoke Plugin for Sphinx
This is a plugin which allows the documentation of invoke tasks with sphinx `autodoc`.
An invoke task looks like a normal function but the `@task` decorator creates a `Task` object behind the scenes.
Documenting these with `autodoc` can lead to errors or unexpected results.

## Installation
`pip install invoke-plugin-for-sphinx`, that's it.

## Usage
Add the plugin to the extensions list:

```py
extensions = ["invoke_plugin_for_sphinx"]
```

Then you can use `.. automodule::` as usual.
Behind the scenes, the function documenter of `autodoc` is extended to also handle tasks equal to functions.
Therefore the same configurations, limitations and features apply.

## Development
This project uses `uv`.
To setup a venv for development use
`python3.14 -m venv venv && pip install uv && uv sync --all-groups && rm -rf venv/`.
Then use `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate your venv.

## Build and Publish

This project uses `setuptools` as the dependency management and build tool.
To publish a new release, follow these steps:
* Update the version in the `pyproject.toml`
* Add an entry in the changelog
* Push a new tag like `vX.X.X` to trigger the release
