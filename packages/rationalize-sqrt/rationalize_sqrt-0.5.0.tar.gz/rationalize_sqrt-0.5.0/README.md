# â–³
  This project is intended to be used as a simple calculator for bruteforcing and displaying different variations of irrational square-roots. 
  I quickly built this for myself in a couple hours to fix an issue with my design work. By using this app I found a strong candidate for the 
  side lengths of my hexagon's broken down model. When splayed out into triangles and squares each side length could be approximately represented
  in whole numbers.

*Although it's useful for design work where exact precision isn't necessary, this may not be the solution if you're looking to replace the irrational numbers within a 30/60/90 or 45/45/90 triangle
with exact whole ones.

## The Problem

<img width="381" height="381" alt="rationalizing1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af2f8025-3369-4324-a13b-dd82ce8c7e56" />

A simple issue may be encountered when arranging equally sized squares onto triangle faces. They will not align back onto the standard grid ever again.
Image above shows a case where an attempt is made to align the squares back with the grid using another 45 degree right triangle.


## Getting The Solution

<img width="381" height="381" alt="rationalizing2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77692b77-aad4-4713-9a49-53dbca9d0c96" />

The previous example can be broken down into a function that solves for the marked distance:

### $y=\frac{3}{2}\cdot x\sqrt{2}-\ 2\cdot x$ 

where x is the width of a square.

Substituting x with `58` (which I hand picked from a list my app generated), we can simplify $58\sqrt{2}$ into 82 because the real result is only two 
hundredths of a unit away:

### $y=\frac{3}{2}\cdot82-\ 2\cdot58$

the equation then quietly resolves to 7

## applying the solution

Finally, we can fill the gap left by the odd geometry with a rectangle that's exactly 65 units in length.
