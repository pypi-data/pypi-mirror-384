"""
Surface Area Calculations for Streamline-Based Transport Analysis.

This module provides geometric utilities for computing surface areas and average
heights between streamlines in heterogeneous aquifer systems. These calculations
support direct estimation of pore volume distributions from streamline analysis,
providing an alternative to gamma distribution approximations.

Available functions:

- :func:`compute_average_heights` - Compute average heights of clipped trapezoids formed by
  streamlines. Trapezoids have vertical sides defined by x_edges and top/bottom edges defined
  by y_edges (2D array). Clipping bounds (y_lower, y_upper) restrict the integration domain.
  Returns area/width ratios representing average heights for use in pore volume calculations
  from streamline geometry.

    Compute average heights of clipped trapezoids.

    Trapezoids have vertical left and right sides, with corners at:
    - top-left: (y_edges[i, j], x_edges[j])
    - top-right: (y_edges[i, j+1], x_edges[j+1])
    - bottom-left: (y_edges[i+1, j], x_edges[j])
    - bottom-right: (y_edges[i+1, j+1], x_edges[j+1])

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_edges : numpy.ndarray
        1D array of x coordinates, shape (n_x,)
    y_edges : numpy.ndarray
        2D array of y coordinates, shape (n_y, n_x)
    y_lower : float
        Lower horizontal clipping bound
    y_upper : float
        Upper horizontal clipping bound

    Returns
    -------
    avg_heights : numpy.ndarray
        2D array of average heights (area/width) for each clipped trapezoid,
