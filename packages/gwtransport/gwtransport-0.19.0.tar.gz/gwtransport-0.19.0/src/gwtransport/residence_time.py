"""
Residence Time Calculations for Retarded Compound Transport.

This module provides functions to compute residence times for compounds traveling through
aquifer systems, accounting for flow variability, pore volume, and retardation due to
physical or chemical interactions with the aquifer matrix. Residence time represents the
duration a compound spends traveling from infiltration to extraction points, depending on
flow rate (higher flow yields shorter residence time), pore volume (larger volume yields
longer residence time), and retardation factor (interaction with matrix yields longer
residence time).

Available functions:

- :func:`residence_time` - Compute residence times at specific time indices. Supports both
  forward (infiltration to extraction) and reverse (extraction to infiltration) directions.
  Handles single or multiple pore volumes (2D output for multiple volumes). Returns residence
  times in days using cumulative flow integration for accurate time-varying flow handling.

- :func:`residence_time_mean` - Compute mean residence times over time intervals. Calculates
  average residence time between specified time edges using linear averaging to properly weight
  time-varying residence times. Supports same directional options as residence_time. Particularly
  useful for time-binned analysis.

- :func:`fraction_explained` - Compute fraction of aquifer pore volumes with valid residence
  times. Indicates how many pore volumes have sufficient flow history to compute residence time.
  Returns values in [0, 1] where 1.0 means all volumes are fully informed. Useful for assessing
  spin-up periods and data coverage. NaN residence times indicate insufficient flow history.

    Compute the mean residence time of a retarded compound in the aquifer between specified time edges.

    This function calculates the average residence time of a retarded compound in the aquifer
    between specified time intervals. It can compute both extraction to infiltration modeling (extraction direction:
    when was extracted water infiltrated) and infiltration to extraction modeling (infiltration direction: when will
    infiltrated water be extracted).

    The function handles time series data by computing the cumulative flow and using linear
    interpolation and averaging to determine mean residence times between the specified time edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flow : array-like
        Flow rate of water in the aquifer [m3/day]. Should be an array of flow values
        corresponding to the intervals defined by flow_tedges.
    flow_tedges : array-like
        Time edges for the flow data, as datetime64 objects. These define the time
        intervals for which the flow values are provided.
    tedges_out : array-like
        Output time edges as datetime64 objects. These define the intervals for which
        the mean residence times will be calculated.
    aquifer_pore_volume : float or array-like
        Pore volume of the aquifer [m3]. Can be a single value or an array of values
        for multiple pore volume scenarios.
    direction : {'extraction_to_infiltration', 'infiltration_to_extraction'}, optional
        Direction of the flow calculation:
        * 'extraction_to_infiltration': Extraction to infiltration modeling - how many days ago was the extracted water infiltrated
        * 'infiltration_to_extraction': Infiltration to extraction modeling - how many days until the infiltrated water is extracted
        Default is 'extraction_to_infiltration'.
    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Retardation factor of the compound in the aquifer [dimensionless].
        A value greater than 1.0 indicates that the compound moves slower than water.
        Default is 1.0 (no retardation).

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Mean residence time of the retarded compound in the aquifer [days] for each interval
        defined by tedges_out. The first dimension corresponds to the different pore volumes
        and the second to the residence times between tedges_out.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function converts datetime objects to days since the start of the time series.
    - For extraction_to_infiltration direction, the function computes how many days ago water was infiltrated.
    - For infiltration_to_extraction direction, the function computes how many days until water will be extracted.
    - The function uses linear interpolation for computing residence times at specific points
      and linear averaging for computing mean values over intervals.
