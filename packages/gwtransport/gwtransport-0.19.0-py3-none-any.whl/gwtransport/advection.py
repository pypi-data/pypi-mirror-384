"""
Advective Transport Modeling for 1D Aquifer Systems.

This module provides functions to model compound transport by advection in one-dimensional
aquifer systems, enabling prediction of solute or temperature concentrations in extracted
water based on infiltration data and aquifer properties. The model assumes one-dimensional
groundwater flow where water infiltrates with concentration ``cin``, flows through the aquifer
with pore volume distribution, compounds are transported with retarded velocity (retardation
factor >= 1.0), and water is extracted with concentration ``cout``.

Available functions:

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction_series` - Single pore volume, time-shift only. Shifts
  infiltration time edges forward by residence time. Concentration values remain unchanged
  (cout = cin). No support for custom output time edges. Use case: Deterministic transport
  with single flow path.

- :func:`infiltration_to_extraction` - Arbitrary pore volume distribution, convolution.
  Supports explicit distribution of aquifer pore volumes with flow-weighted averaging.
  Flexible output time resolution via cout_tedges. Use case: Known pore volume distribution
  from streamline analysis.

- :func:`gamma_infiltration_to_extraction` - Gamma-distributed pore volumes, convolution.
  Models aquifer heterogeneity with 2-parameter gamma distribution. Parameterizable via
  (alpha, beta) or (mean, std). Discretizes gamma distribution into equal-probability bins.
  Use case: Heterogeneous aquifer with calibrated gamma parameters.

- :func:`extraction_to_infiltration_series` - Single pore volume, time-shift only
  (deconvolution). Shifts extraction time edges backward by residence time. Concentration
  values remain unchanged (cin = cout). Symmetric inverse of infiltration_to_extraction_series.
  Use case: Backward tracing with single flow path.

- :func:`extraction_to_infiltration` - Arbitrary pore volume distribution, deconvolution.
  Inverts forward transport for arbitrary pore volume distributions. Symmetric inverse of
  infiltration_to_extraction. Flow-weighted averaging in reverse direction. Use case:
  Estimating infiltration history from extraction data.

- :func:`gamma_extraction_to_infiltration` - Gamma-distributed pore volumes, deconvolution.
  Inverts forward transport for gamma-distributed pore volumes. Symmetric inverse of
  gamma_infiltration_to_extraction. Use case: Calibrating infiltration conditions from
  extraction measurements.

    Compute extraction time edges from infiltration time edges using residence time shifts.

    This function shifts infiltration time edges forward in time based on residence
    times computed from flow rates and aquifer properties. The concentration values remain
    unchanged (cout equals cin), only the time edges are shifted. This assumes a single pore
    volume (no distribution) and deterministic advective transport.

    NOTE: This function is specifically designed for single aquifer pore volumes and does not
    support custom output time edges (cout_tedges). For distributions of aquifer pore volumes
    or custom output time grids, use `infiltration_to_extraction` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flow : array-like
        Flow rate values in the aquifer [m3/day].
        Length must match the number of time bins defined by tedges (len(tedges) - 1).
    tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time edges defining bins for both cin and flow data. Has length of len(flow) + 1.
    aquifer_pore_volume : float
        Single aquifer pore volume [m3] used to compute residence times.
    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Retardation factor of the compound in the aquifer (default 1.0).
        Values > 1.0 indicate slower transport due to sorption/interaction.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DatetimeIndex

        The concentration values in the extracted water (cout) equal cin, but are

    Compute the concentration of the infiltrating water from extracted water (deconvolution).

    This function implements an extraction to infiltration advection model (inverse of infiltration_to_extraction)
    where cout and flow values correspond to the same aligned time bins defined by tedges.

    SYMMETRIC RELATIONSHIP:
    - infiltration_to_extraction: cin + tedges → cout + cout_tedges
    - extraction_to_infiltration: cout + tedges → cin + cin_tedges

    The algorithm (symmetric to infiltration_to_extraction):
    1. Computes residence times for each pore volume at cint time edges
    2. Calculates extraction time edges by adding residence times (reverse of infiltration_to_extraction)
    3. Determines temporal overlaps between extraction and cout time windows
    4. Creates flow-weighted overlap matrices normalized by total weights
    5. Computes weighted contributions and averages across pore volumes

    Parameters
    ----------
    cout : array-like
        Concentration values of extracted water [concentration units].
        Length must match the number of time bins defined by tedges.

        len(cout) + 1 and len(flow) + 1.
    cin_tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time edges for output (infiltration) data bins. Has length of desired output + 1.
        Can have different time alignment and resolution than tedges.
    aquifer_pore_volumes : array-like
        Array of aquifer pore volumes [m3] representing the distribution
        of residence times in the aquifer system.
    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Retardation factor of the compound in the aquifer (default 1.0).

    Returns
    -------
