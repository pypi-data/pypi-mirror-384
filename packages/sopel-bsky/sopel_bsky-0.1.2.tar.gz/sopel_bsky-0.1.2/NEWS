## Changelog

### 0.1.2

* Bumped `atproto` library version
* Fixed parsing ISO-format timestamps without milliseconds
* Meta-updates (package metadata, workflows)

**Note:** This release doesn't support Python 3.14 (which became stable earlier
in October 2025), because `atproto` doesn't support it yet.


### 0.1.1

Bumped `atproto` library version. Skeets with video (a recently added feature)
no longer cause exceptions.


### 0.1.0

First release of `sopel-bsky`.
