# Evaluation and Feedback

## User acceptance testing results
- Validated via `examples/` and test suite; `examples/detection_demo.py` demonstrates detection in practice.

## Feedback summary
- Channels: GitLab Issues; email in `README.md`.
- Themes (typical): performance tuning, whitelisting guidance, framework-specific questions.

## Lessons learned
- Decorator-first API eases adoption.
- Whitelisting and interval tuning are essential for balancing fidelity vs overhead.
- Auto-healing is powerful but should be rolled out cautiously.
