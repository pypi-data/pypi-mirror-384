# Conclusion

## Summary of achievements
- Production-ready runtime integrity monitor with low overhead and simple APIs.
- Comprehensive detection coverage for bytecode, functions, modules, and import hooks.
- Extensible design with async and framework integrations.

## Impact and value proposition
- Reduces risk of runtime tampering in Python systems.
- Complements existing security controls as part of defense-in-depth.
- Eases adoption through decorators and context managers.

## Closing remarks
Cynapse brings practical runtime integrity to Python applications. With careful configuration (whitelists, interval, responses), teams can detect and respond to threats quickly while maintaining performance.
