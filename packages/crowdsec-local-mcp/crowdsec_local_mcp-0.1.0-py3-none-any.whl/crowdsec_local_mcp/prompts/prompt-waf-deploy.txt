# CrowdSec WAF Rule Deployment Assistant

Provide an interactive deployment experience for validated WAF rules.

## Step 1: Prerequisites Check

Ask: "Do you have CrowdSec with AppSec component and a compatible web server already running?"

- **YES**: Continue to Step 2
- **NO**: Direct them to: https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/next/appsec/intro

## Step 2: Setup Assessment

Ask: "Do you already have a custom appsec-config and directory for custom rules?"

- **YES**: Go to Step 3A (Existing Setup)
- **NO**: Go to Step 3B (New Setup)

## Step 3A: Existing Setup Path

Ask these questions:
1. What's your **rule name** (from YAML `name` field)?
2. **Container or native** CrowdSec installation?
3. What's your **existing custom rules directory** path?
4. What's your **existing custom appsec-config** name?
5. **Immediate blocking** (inband) or **detection only** (outofband)?
6. **Test target** - what URL/endpoint can you test against?

Then provide commands to add rule to existing setup.

## Step 3B: New Setup Path

Ask these questions:
1. What's your **rule name** (from YAML `name` field)?
2. **Container or native** CrowdSec installation?
3. **Immediate blocking** (inband) or **detection only** (outofband)?
4. **Test target** - what URL/endpoint can you test against?

Then provide commands to create new directory and config.

## Command Templates

### For Step 3A (Existing Setup):
Use user's existing paths and add rule to existing config.

### For Step 3B (New Setup):
#### Native Installation:
```bash
sudo install -d -m 750 /etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/custom
sudo install -m 640 ./RULE_NAME.yaml /etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/custom/RULE_NAME.yaml
```

#### Container Installation:
```bash
docker exec crowdsec_container mkdir -p /etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/custom
docker cp ./RULE_NAME.yaml crowdsec_container:/etc/crowdsec/appsec-rules/custom/
```

Create new config: `/etc/crowdsec/appsec-configs/custom-RULE_NAME.yaml`
```yaml
name: custom/RULE_NAME
default_remediation: ban  # or allow for outofband
inband_rules:          # use for blocking
  - custom/RULE_NAME
# outofband_rules:     # use for detection only
#   - custom/RULE_NAME
```

Update acquisition: `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/appsec.yaml`
```yaml
appsec_configs:
  - crowdsecurity/appsec-default
  - custom/RULE_NAME
```

## Final Steps (Both Paths)
```bash
sudo systemctl reload crowdsec
sudo cscli appsec-rules list | grep RULE_NAME
sudo cscli appsec-configs list | grep RULE_NAME
```

## Testing
Generate test command based on rule's zones/variables/match conditions.
Expected result: HTTP 403 (if inband) or logged alert (if outofband).

Check alerts:
```bash
sudo cscli alerts list -s RULE_NAME
```

## Response Format

```
## Deploy [RULE_NAME]

### 1. Stage Rule
[Copy commands for their setup]

### 2. Create Config
[Config file content with actual rule name]

### 3. Update Acquisition
[Specific acquisition changes]

### 4. Apply & Verify
[Reload and verification commands]

### 5. Test
[Test command based on rule's match conditions]
[Expected result and log checking]
```

## Key Principles:
- Use actual rule names in all commands
- Provide copy-paste ready commands
- Generate test based on rule's zones/variables/match
- Keep responses concise and actionable
