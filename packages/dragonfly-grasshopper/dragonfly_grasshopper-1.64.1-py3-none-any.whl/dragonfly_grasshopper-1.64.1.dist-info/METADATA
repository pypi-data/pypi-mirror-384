# dragonfly-grasshopper

:dragon: :green_book: Dragonfly plugin for Grasshopper (aka. dragonfly[+]).

This repository contains all Grasshopper components for the dragonfly plugin.
The package includes both the user objects (`.ghuser`), the Python source (`.py`),
and a JSON version of the grasshopper component data.
Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper components and, in order to
run the plugin, the core libraries must be installed in a way that they can be
discovered by Rhino (see dependencies).
