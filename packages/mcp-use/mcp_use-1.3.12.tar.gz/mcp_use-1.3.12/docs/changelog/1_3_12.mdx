This release focuses on middleware introduction and comprehensive documentation improvements. The most significant additions include a new middleware system and automatic API documentation generation.

## New Features

### Middleware System
**[PR #269](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/269)**

Introduced a comprehensive middleware system that allows for request/response interception and processing. The middleware framework supports custom logic injection, metrics collection, and request transformation capabilities.

For a detailed technical deep-dive into the middleware architecture and design decisions, see our [Middleware Pipeline blog post](/blog/middleware).

### Automatic API Documentation
**[PR #301](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/301)**

Implemented automatic API documentation generation to streamline the development workflow. This feature automatically generates comprehensive API references from code annotations and docstrings, ensuring documentation stays current with code changes.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Tool Result Standardization
**[PR #288](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/288)**

Fixed tool result formatting to ensure consistent output across different MCP servers and tools. The system now returns tool results in a standardized format, improving compatibility and predictability.

### Duplicate User Message Prevention
**[PR #287](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/287)**

Resolved an issue where user messages were being duplicated in conversation history, particularly when memory features were enabled. The fix ensures clean conversation tracking and prevents redundant message storage.

### Agent Memory Enhancement
**[PR #187](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/187)**

Improved agent memory handling to prevent duplicate user queries when memory is enabled. This enhancement ensures more efficient memory usage and cleaner conversation flow.

### Test Server Execution Fix
**[PR #298](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/298)**

Fixed test server execution issues by properly using executable paths for shared dependencies. This improvement ensures reliable test execution across different environments.

## Maintenance & Documentation

### Middleware Metrics Enhancement
**[PR #299](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/299)**

Enhanced middleware metrics collection for better performance and maintainability. The updated system provides more accurate metrics and improved observability for MCP operations.

### Documentation Enhancements
**[PRs #301](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/301), [#282](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/282)**

Comprehensive documentation updates including:
- Enhanced API reference generation
- Updated TypeScript integration examples
- Removed deprecated `from_dict` method references
- Improved developer onboarding materials

### Docker Networking Documentation
**[PR #286](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/286)**

Added documentation addressing common Docker networking issues, helping developers troubleshoot containerized MCP server deployments.

### Limited Memory Example
**[Commit 6a807a1](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/commit/6a807a1)**

Added practical example demonstrating limited memory usage patterns for MCP agents, showcasing efficient memory management techniques.

## Automated Updates

### Dependency Management
**[PR #267](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/267) by @github-actions[bot]**

Regular automated updates to dependent package information, ensuring compatibility with the latest ecosystem versions and maintaining security posture.

### Documentation Workflow Improvements
**[PRs #173](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/173), [#301](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/pull/301)**

Enhanced documentation workflows with:
- Mintlify CLI integration for improved documentation generation
- Link checking to ensure documentation integrity
- Automated API reference updates
