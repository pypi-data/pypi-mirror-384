## Overview

MCP-use provides **optional observability integration** to help you debug, monitor, and optimize your AI agents. Observability gives you visibility into:

- **Agent execution flow** with detailed step-by-step tracing
- **Tool usage patterns** and performance metrics
- **LLM calls** with token usage and costs
- **Error tracking** and debugging information
- **Conversation analytics** across sessions

<Warning>
**Completely Optional**: Observability is entirely opt-in and requires zero code changes to your existing workflows.
</Warning>

## Supported Platforms

MCP-use integrates with two leading observability platforms:

- **[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com)** - Open-source LLM observability with self-hosting options
- **[Laminar](https://www.lmnr.ai)** - Comprehensive AI application monitoring platform
- **[LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/)** - LangChain's observability platform

Choose the platform that best fits your needs. Each platform automatically initializes when you import mcp_use if their environment variables are set.

## What Gets Traced

These platforms automatically capture:
- **Agent conversations** - Full query/response pairs
- **LLM calls** - Model usage, tokens, and costs
- **Tool executions** - Which MCP tools were used and their outputs
- **Performance metrics** - Execution times and step counts
- **Error tracking** - Failed operations with full context

### Example Trace View
Your observability dashboard will show something like:

```
üîç mcp_agent_run
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üí¨ LLM Call (gpt-4)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Input: "Help me analyze the sales data"
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output: "I'll help you analyze the sales data..."
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß Tool: read_file
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Input: {"path": "sales_data.csv"}
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output: "CSV content loaded..."
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß Tool: analyze_data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Input: {"data": "...", "analysis_type": "summary"}
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output: "Analysis complete..."
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üí¨ Final Response
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "Based on the sales data analysis..."
```

# Laminar Integration

[Laminar](https://www.lmnr.ai) provides comprehensive AI application monitoring with advanced analytics.

## Setup Laminar

### 1. Install Laminar
```bash
pip install lmnr
```

### 2. Get Your API Key
- Sign up at [lmnr.ai](https://www.lmnr.ai)
- Create a new project
- Copy your project API key

### 3. Set Environment Variable
```bash
export LAMINAR_PROJECT_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 4. Start Using
```python
# Laminar automatically initializes when mcp_use is imported
import mcp_use
from mcp_use import MCPAgent

agent = MCPAgent(llm=your_llm, ...)
result = await agent.run("Your query")  # Automatically traced!
```

## Laminar Features

MCP_USE_LAMINAR="false"
```

# Additional Information

## Privacy & Data Security

### What's Collected
- **Queries and responses** (for debugging context)
- **Tool inputs/outputs** (to understand workflows)
- **Model metadata** (provider, model name, tokens)
- **Performance data** (execution times, success rates)

### What's NOT Collected
- **No personal information** beyond what you send to your LLM
- **No API keys** or credentials
- **No unauthorized data** - you control what gets traced

### Security Features
- **HTTPS encryption** for all data transmission
- **Self-hosting options** available (Langfuse)
- **Easy to disable** with environment variables
- **Data ownership** - you control your observability data

## Disabling Observability

### Temporarily Disable
```bash
# Disable Langfuse
export MCP_USE_LANGFUSE="false"

# Disable Laminar
export MCP_USE_LAMINAR="false"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Package not installed" errors**
```bash
# Install the required packages
pip install langfuse  # For Langfuse
pip install lmnr      # For Laminar
```

**"API keys not found" warnings**
```bash
# Check your environment variables
echo $LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
echo $LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
echo $LAMINAR_PROJECT_API_KEY
```

**No traces appearing in dashboard**
- Verify your API keys are correct
- Check that observability isn't disabled (`MCP_USE_LANGFUSE` or `MCP_USE_LAMINAR` set to "false")
- Check network connectivity to the platform
- Enable debug logging: `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`

**Self-hosted Langfuse connection issues**
For self-hosted Langfuse instances, set the `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variable:
```bash
export LANGFUSE_HOST="https://your-langfuse-instance.com"
```
