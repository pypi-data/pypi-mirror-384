# just-agents-tools

Part of [just-agents](https://github.com/longevity-genie/just-agents) - a lightweight, straightforward library for LLM agents that focuses on simplicity over unnecessary abstractions. While other libraries often over-engineer LLM interactions, just-agents keeps things simple and transparent, treating LLM interactions primarily as string operations with clear templating.

## Overview

The tools subpackage aims to provide useful, commonly needed functionalities that can be easily integrated with just-agents, while maintaining:
- 🎯 Simplicity first - no over-engineering
- 📝 Clear, readable implementations
- 🔧 Easy integration with just-agents
- 🚫 No unnecessary abstractions or dependencies

## Status

🚧 This subpackage is currently under development. Tools will be added based on common use cases and community needs.

## Contributing

If you have ideas for useful tools that could benefit the just-agents ecosystem, feel free to contribute! Remember to keep implementations simple and focused.
