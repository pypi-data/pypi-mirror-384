## RAIL LePHARE

This package allows users to run the [LePHARE code](https://github.com/lephare-photoz/lephare/) 
through [RAIL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL). 
It can be installed via pip with the following command. 
Full documentation is available at the main [LePHARE documentation](https://lephare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

```console
pip install pz-rail-lephare
```

## RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers

This package is part of the larger ecosystem of Photometric Redshifts
in [RAIL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL). This package in particular
is concerned with wrapping the [LePHARE](https://gitlab.lam.fr/Galaxies/LEPHARE/) template fitting code within RAIL.

### Developer installation

This package can be installed from source using the following commands to allow working on the code.
```console
git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail_lephare.git
cd rail_lephare
conda install -c conda-forge pytables
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Please consider also inviting the developers as co-authors on publications resulting from your use of RAIL by [making an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail/issues/new/choose).
A convenient list of what to cite may be found under [Citing RAIL](https://rail-hub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/citing.html) on ReadTheDocs.
Additionally, several of the codes accessible through the RAIL ecosystem must be cited if used in a publication.

### Citing this package

If you use this package, you should also cite the appropriate papers for each
code used.  A list of such codes is included in the 
[Citing RAIL](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/citing.html)
section of the main RAIL Read The Docs page.
