This is a NOMAD parser for [QUANTUM ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/). It will read QUANTUM ESPRESSO input and
output files and provide all information in NOMAD's unified Metainfo based Archive format.

For QUANTUM ESPRESSO please provide at least the files from this table if applicable to your
calculations (remember that you can provide more files if you want):

|Filename| Description|
|---|---|
|`<text_file>`|**Mainfile:** a plain text file w/arbitrary name. \
One of the top lines must contain '`Program PWSCF.*starts`', \
where '`.*`' means an arbitrary number '`*`' of arbitrary \
characters '`.`'|"

The PWSCF entry is linked automatically to QUANTUM ESPRESSO worflow entries that
are found in the directory or the sub-directories of the mainfile.
