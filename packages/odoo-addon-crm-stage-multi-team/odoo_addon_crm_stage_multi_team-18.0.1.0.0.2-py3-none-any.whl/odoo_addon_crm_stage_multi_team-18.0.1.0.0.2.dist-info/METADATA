This module extends the CRM functionality to support **multi-team
stages**.

**Features:**

- Adds a many2many field ``team_ids`` on CRM stages, allowing a stage to
  be shared by multiple sales teams.

**Use cases:**

- A company with multiple sales teams sharing some stages but also
  having exclusive ones.
- Cleaner kanban views per team, avoiding irrelevant stages.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
