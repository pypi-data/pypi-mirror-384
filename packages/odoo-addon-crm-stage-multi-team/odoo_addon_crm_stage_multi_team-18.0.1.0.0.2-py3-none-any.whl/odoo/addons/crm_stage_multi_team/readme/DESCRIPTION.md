This module extends the CRM functionality to support **multi-team
stages**.

**Features:**

- Adds a many2many field `team_ids` on CRM stages, allowing a stage to
  be shared by multiple sales teams.

**Use cases:**

- A company with multiple sales teams sharing some stages but also
  having exclusive ones.
- Cleaner kanban views per team, avoiding irrelevant stages.
