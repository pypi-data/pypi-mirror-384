**Description:** Amazon Nova Pro 1.0 is a highly capable multimodal foundation model from Amazon Nova, offering a strong balance of accuracy, speed, and cost for processing text, images, and video. Its context window is 300,000 tokens, which enables handling very large inputs (including up to ~30 minutes of video input) in a single request.

Use ‘--enable_latency_optimized [false/true]’ (default false) to disable/enable the latency optimized inference accordingly. Note that if enabled, costs may increase. Check the rate card for more information.
