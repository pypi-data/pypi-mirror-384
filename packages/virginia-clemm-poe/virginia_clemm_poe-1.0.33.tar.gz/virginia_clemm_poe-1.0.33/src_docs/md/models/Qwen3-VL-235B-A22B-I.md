## Bot Information

**Creator:** @novitaai

**Description:** This generation delivers comprehensive upgrades across the board: superior text understanding & generation, deeper visual perception & reasoning, extended context length, enhanced spatial and video dynamics comprehension, and stronger agent interaction capabilities.

Available in Dense and MoE architectures that scale from edge to cloud, with Instruct and reasoning‑enhanced Thinking editions for flexible, on‑demand deployment.

Key Enhancements:
Visual Agent: Operates PC/mobile GUIs—recognizes elements, understands functions, invokes tools, completes tasks.

Visual Coding Boost: Generates Draw.io/HTML/CSS/JS from images/videos.

Advanced Spatial Perception: Judges object positions, viewpoints, and occlusions; provides stronger 2D grounding and enables 3D grounding for spatial reasoning and embodied AI.

Long Context & Video Understanding: Native 256K context, expandable to 1M; handles books and hours-long video with full recall and second-level indexing.

Enhanced Multimodal Reasoning: Excels in STEM/Math—causal analysis and logical, evidence-based answers.

Upgraded Visual Recognition: Broader, higher-quality pretraining is able to "recognize everything"—celebrities, anime, products, landmarks, flora/fauna, etc.

Expanded OCR: Supports 32 languages (up from 19); robust in low light, blur, and tilt; better with rare/ancient characters and jargon; improved long-document structure parsing.

Text Understanding on par with pure LLMs: Seamless text–vision fusion for lossless, unified comprehension.
