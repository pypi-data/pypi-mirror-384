## Bot Information

**Creator:** @openai

**Description:** GPT-5-Codex is a specialized version of GPT-5 optimized for software engineering and coding workflows. It is designed for both interactive development sessions and long, independent execution of complex engineering tasks. The model supports building projects from scratch, feature development, debugging, large-scale refactoring, and code review. Compared to GPT-5, Codex is more steerable, adheres closely to developer instructions, and produces cleaner, higher-quality code outputs. It supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and a 400k token context window.
To instruct the bot to use more reasoning effort, add `--reasoning_effort` to the end of your message with one of "low", "medium", or "high"
