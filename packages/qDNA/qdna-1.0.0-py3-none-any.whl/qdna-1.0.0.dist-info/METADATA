# Welcome to QuantumDNA

This python package can be cited as:

> Herb, D. et al. QuantumDNA: A python package for analyzing quantum charge dynamics in DNA and exploring its biological relevance. *Computer Physics Communications 313*, 109626 (2025). DOI: [10.1016/j.cpc.2025.109626](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2025.109626)

## Introduction

The study of DNA charge dynamics is a highly interdisciplinary field and plays an important role in processes such as DNA damage detection, protein-DNA interactions, and DNA-based nanotechnology. However, despite significant progress in each of these areas, knowledge often remains inaccessible to researchers in other scientific communities. To bridge this gap, we have developed QuantumDNA: an open-source python package for simulating DNA charge transfer and excited state dynamics using quantum physical methods.

QuantumDNA uses a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approach combined with tight-binding models and open quantum systems techniques. This way one can quickly scan large numbers DNA sequences, enabling statistical studies of genetic and epigenetic phenomena.

Whether you're a scientist, student, or just curious, QuantumDNA: dive in and start exploring!

</p>

### Features

* Coarse-graining approach: linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) and tight-binding models to efficiently simulate DNA charge dynamics.
* Parallelized Calculations: Enabling the analysis of large numbers of DNA seqeunces.
* Integration with publicly accessible databases: Users can input geometries from DNA structure databases as PDB files.
* GUI: Designed for researchers across physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine.

## What's new

* Added a graphical user interface (GUI) to the package which is based on the [customtkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) package.
* Added a Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks available on another [GitHub repopsitory](https://github.com/dehe1011/QuantumDNA-notebooks).

## Getting started

### Quick Installation

For a quick installation, you can install the `qDNA` package via pip:

```bash
pip install qDNA
```

To ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with other packages, we recommend using a virtual environment. For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

### Example Program

To test QuantumDNA, you can run the following simple example where the exciton lifetime and the average charge separation of a double-stranded GCG DNA sequence are calculated. You can try different sequences, tight-binding models, and keyword arguments to investigate how these factors affect the exciton lifetime and average charge separation. For example, you might find that in general more uniform sequences show higher values.

```python

from qDNA import calc_lifetime, calc_dipole

# input
tb_sites = get_tb_sites('GCG')
kwargs = dict(tb_model_name = 'ELM', unit='rad/ps', relax_rate=3, source='Hawke2010')

# calculation
eva = Evaluation(tb_sites, **kwargs)
lifetime = eva.calc_lifetime()
charge_separation = eva.calc_charge_separation()

# output
print(f"Exciton lifetime {lifetime} fs")
print(f"Average charge separation {charge_separation} A")
```

The documentation webpage for the latest release is available for reading on [Read The Docs](https://quantumdna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Tutorials can be found in a separate GitHub repository [QuantumDNA-notebooks](https://github.com/dehe1011/QuantumDNA-notebooks).

## Graphical User Interface

The `qDNA` package includes a GUI that provides an intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the package's functionalities. You can access the GUI with the following code:

```python

from qDNA.gui import QDNApp

QDNApp().run()
```

The GUI allows you to easily explore and utilize the capabilities of the `qDNA` package. Below are some examples demonstrating its use:

* **Usage example:** Perform simulations with geometries from publically availbale databases (here: PDB geometry of the 1BNA sequence from [RCSB.org](https://www.rcsb.org)).

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/5_GUI.png" alt="GUI Screenshot.">
</p>
<blockquote><em> Simulations with Real Geometries via the GUI

**(a)** A Protein Data Bank (PDB) file containing the DNA geometry was obtained from [RCSB.org](https://www.rcsb.org) (identifier: `1BNA`) and modified using `Biovia Discovery Studio`. The subsequence selected for simulation is highlighted in blue.

**(b)** The PDB Input Window allows users to upload the modified PDB file, specify an identifier, and select a Tight-Binding (TB) model. Clicking the "Save" button computes TB parameters.

**(c)** To simulate the highlighted sequence from (a), set the upper strand to `02G_03C_04G` and the lower strand to `23C_22G_21C`. Ensure the identifier (e.g., `1BNA`) is selected as the source. Exciton calculations can be performed using the Evaluation tab, with results displayed in the console at the bottom right (highlighted in green).

**(d)** The plotting window provides a heatmap visualization of time-evolved populations for the DNA sequence highlighted in (a). All simulation steps can also be performed programmatically without the GUI, such as using Jupyter Notebooks.</em></blockquote>
