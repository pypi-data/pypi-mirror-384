# fMRI Demo

This demo illustrates how you can set up an experiment for use with an fMRI scanner that sends an emulated keypress out as it scans. 

We highly recommend that you also take a look at [this page](https://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/nonSlipTiming.html "Non-slip Timing")

If your scanner sends out a trigger via a parallel or serial port, you can find code to copy and paste in your wait_for_scanner routine on [this page](https://psychopy.org/hardware/fMRI.html#fmri "fMRI")
