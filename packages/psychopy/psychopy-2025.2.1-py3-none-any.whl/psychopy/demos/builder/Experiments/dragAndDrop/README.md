Drag and Drop Demo
==================
The demonstration uses the `draggable` attribute of all Components in the "Stimuli" category to create a drag and drop puzzle game. The game will save the position of each shape for easy comparison after the fact.

To change the answers to this game, see the `make_shapes` experiment in the `stimuli` folder. **Top Tip:** Press ALT + SHIFT + R from Builder to open the folder containing the current experiment.
