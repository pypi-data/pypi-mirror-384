# Button Box Component Demo

This demo shows a minimal example of the Button Box Component. Currently, it is in keyboard emulation mode - meaning you can press keys on your keyboard to emulate button presses. To configure it to use a particular kind of button box, you should install the relevant plugin (e.g. `psychopy-cedrus` for Cedrus devices), which will add options to the Component's "Device backend" parameter. 

Once set up, you should be able to push buttons on your device and see corresponding circles on screen turn white! To use more than the first 5 buttons, just copy the existing circles and change their fill color & position.
