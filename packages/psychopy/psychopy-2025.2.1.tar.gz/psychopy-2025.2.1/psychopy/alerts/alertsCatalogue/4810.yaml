label: No config for named device

synopsis: |
  Your experiment refers to a device by name which has not been setup in Builder's Device Manager dialog.

details: |
  From 2025.2.0, devices are setup in a dedicated Device Manager dialog and then referred to by name in Components. If you're seeing this message, it means there's a Component in your experiment which refers to a named device which has not been setup. This is common when running experiments made by someone else, or made on a different computer, as they will have setup using their devices.

solutions: |
  Setup the named device in Builder's Device Manager dialog
