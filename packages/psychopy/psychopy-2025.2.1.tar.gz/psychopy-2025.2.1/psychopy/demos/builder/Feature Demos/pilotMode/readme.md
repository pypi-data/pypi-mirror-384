# Pilot mode

We've all been there. You have a task which is long and laborious because, basically, it needs to be. That's all well and good for the participant, but what about the poor experimentor! You shouldn't have to sit through repeat after repeat after repeat!

Well, fret no more! This demo shows how to use the variable `PILOTING` (which exists in all PsychoPy experiments as either True or False depending on whether you're in pilot or running mode) to skip over Routines and create dummy keyboard/slider responses to speed through an otherwise quite dull experiment.

Try running with the pilot/run toggle (check the toolbar at the top of Builder view) in both modes to see the difference.
