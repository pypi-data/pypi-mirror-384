"""Load and play sounds

We have used a number of different Python libraries ("backends") for generating
sounds in PsychoPy. We started with `Pygame`, then tried `pyo` and `sounddevice`
but we now strongly recommend you use the PTB setting. That uses the
`PsychPortAudio`_ engine, written by Mario Kleiner for `Psychophysics Toolbox`_.

With the PTB backend you get some options about how aggressively you want to try
for low latency, and there is also an option to pre-schedule a sound to play at
a given time in the future.

By default PsychoPy will try to use the following Libs, in this order, for
sound reproduction but you can alter the order in
preferences > hardware > audioLib:
    ['sounddevice', 'pyo', 'pygame']
For portaudio-based backends (all except for pygame) there is also a
choice of the underlying sound driver (e.g. ASIO, CoreAudio etc).

After importing sound, the sound lib and driver being used will be stored as::
    `psychopy.sound.audioLib`
    `psychopy.sound.audioDriver`
