class ConditionalResampler(Module):

        """
        A resampling algorithm that conditionally only resamples a subset of the particles from each batch.

        Parameters
        ----------
        resampler : Resampler
            The base resampling algorithm to use.
        condition : Callable
            A function that take the time-step data and returns a 1D boolean tensor where True indicates that resampling should be performed for the given batch and False that it should not.

        Notes
        -----
        We generally do not recommend conditionally resampling in a batched DPF context. Classically, conditional resampling is motivated by computation time, resampling algorithms are typically expensive compared to the
        other components of the filtering loop. However, in a parallelised setting each batch can be resampled in parallel, and it is likely that at least one batch does not satisfy the condition.
        For this reason it is likely that the overhead of calculating and applying the condition will more than cancel out any time savings.
