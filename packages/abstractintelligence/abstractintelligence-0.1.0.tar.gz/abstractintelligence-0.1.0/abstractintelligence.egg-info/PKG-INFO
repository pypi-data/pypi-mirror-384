# AbstractIntelligence

AbstractIntelligence is a proactive Generative AI system built upon [AbstractCore](https://github.com/lpalbou/AbstractCore). This project aims to create an intelligent, autonomous AI agent capable of proactive reasoning, decision-making, and task execution.

## Overview

AbstractIntelligence leverages the foundational capabilities of AbstractCore to build a sophisticated AI system that can:
- Proactively analyze situations and contexts
- Make intelligent decisions based on available information
- Execute complex tasks autonomously
- Learn and adapt from interactions and outcomes

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **This project is currently in the initial development phase** ðŸš§

This is a placeholder repository that will be developed into a full-featured proactive GenAI system.

## Architecture

The system is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, following SOLID principles and emphasizing:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Robust general-purpose logic
- Comprehensive testing frameworks
- Scalable and maintainable codebase

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lpalbou/AbstractIntelligence.git
cd AbstractIntelligence

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
from abstractintelligence import AbstractIntelligenceCore

# Example usage (to be implemented)
ai = AbstractIntelligenceCore()
# ai.initialize()
# result = ai.process_task(task_description)
```

## Development Principles

This project follows strict development principles:
- **Intellectual Honesty**: All solutions are thoroughly reasoned and validated
- **Robust General-Purpose Logic**: Solutions work for all inputs, not just test cases
- **Modular Design**: Clean, focused files with single responsibilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Clear separation between tests and implementation code

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure all contributions follow the project's development principles and maintain the high standards of code quality.
