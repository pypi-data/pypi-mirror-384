# 🎉 Self-Learning System COMPLETE!

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: ✅ Fully Functional

---

## What We Built

A **self-improving AI standards system** that learns from corrections automatically and updates CLAUDE.md files without manual intervention.

### The Feedback Loop

```
User corrects Claude → Pattern detected → Frequency tracked → Preference promoted (3+ occurrences) → CLAUDE.md updated → Future sessions improved
```

---

## Architecture (Unified Server)

We built a **unified system** in [server.py](../../src/mcp_standards/server.py):

### Components Integrated:

1. **AutoLogger** (was already there)
   - Tracks tool executions with significance scoring
   - Stores in `tool_logs` table

2. **PatternExtractor** (newly integrated)
   - Detects correction patterns ("use X not Y")
   - Tracks pattern frequency
   - Promotes patterns to preferences after 3+ occurrences
   - Stores in `pattern_frequency` and `tool_preferences` tables

3. **ClaudeMdManager** (newly integrated)
   - Generates CLAUDE.md content from learned preferences
   - Smart merging (preserves manual edits)
   - Creates backups before updates
   - Confidence badges (🟢 🟡 🟠 🔴)

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Pattern Detection

Detects 5 types of patterns:
1. **Explicit corrections**: "use uv not pip"
2. **Implicit rejections**: User edits AI output within 2 minutes
3. **Rule violations**: Compare output vs config files
4. **Workflow patterns**: Always run tests after code changes
5. **Tool preferences**: Prefer certain tools for tasks

### ✅ Confidence-Based Promotion

- **3 occurrences** → Pattern detected (confidence 0.3)
- **5 occurrences** → High confidence (0.7)
- **10 occurrences** → Very high confidence (0.9 - auto-apply)

### ✅ Smart CLAUDE.md Updates

- Preserves manual edits
- Creates timestamped backups
- Adds confidence badges
- Separates project-specific vs global preferences
- Promotes project → global after 3+ projects

### ✅ New MCP Tools

Added 3 new tools to basic server:

1. `get_learned_preferences(category, min_confidence)`
   - Get all learned preferences with confidence scores

2. `suggest_claudemd_update(project_path, min_confidence)`
   - Get suggestions without applying them

3. `update_claudemd(file_path, project_path, min_confidence)`
   - Update CLAUDE.md with learned preferences

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Pattern Learning Test

Ran [test-pattern-learning.py](test-pattern-learning.py):

```
============================================================
Test Summary
============================================================
✓ Tool execution logging: Working
✓ Pattern detection: True
✓ Pattern promotion (3+ occurrences): True
✓ CLAUDE.md suggestions: True
✓ CLAUDE.md update: True

🎉 Self-improving feedback loop is WORKING!
```

### Example Output

After 3 corrections of "use uv not pip", CLAUDE.md automatically includes:

```markdown
## Tool Preferences

- **use uv instead of pip** 🔴 _(applied 0x)_
```

As confidence grows:
- 🔴 Low (0.3-0.5)
- 🟠 Medium (0.5-0.7)
- 🟡 High (0.7-0.9)
- 🟢 Very High (0.9+)

---

## How It Works

### 1. User Correction

```
User: "Actually, use uv not pip for Python package management"
```

### 2. Pattern Detection

```python
# In server.py _log_tool_execution():
patterns = self.pattern_extractor.extract_patterns(
    tool_name="Bash",
    args={"command": "pip install requests"},
    result="use uv not pip",
    project_path="/path/to/project"
)
# Returns: [{"type": "correction", "description": "use uv instead of pip", ...}]
```

### 3. Frequency Tracking

```sql
-- pattern_frequency table
pattern_key | occurrence_count | confidence | promoted
----------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------
correction: | 1                | 0.1        | FALSE
pip→uv      |                  |            |
```

### 4. Promotion (After 3 Occurrences)

```sql
-- tool_preferences table
category   | preference              | confidence | created_at
---------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------
python-pkg | use uv instead of pip   | 0.3        | 2025-10-13
```

### 5. CLAUDE.md Update

User calls `update_claudemd(file_path="./CLAUDE.md")` or system suggests it.

Result: CLAUDE.md now contains the learned preference.

### 6. Future Sessions Improved

Next time Claude starts, it sees "use uv not pip" in CLAUDE.md context → Never makes the mistake again!

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:

1. **[server.py](../../src/mcp_standards/server.py)** (Main integration)
   - Added imports for PatternExtractor and ClaudeMdManager
   - Initialize both in `__init__`
   - Updated `_log_tool_execution` to always extract patterns first
   - Added tool handlers for pattern learning
   - Added MCP tools for preferences and standards generation

2. **[pattern_extractor.py](../../hooks/pattern_extractor.py)** (Pattern detection)
   - Detects correction patterns from tool executions
   - Tracks pattern frequency in database
   - Promotes patterns to preferences after 3+ occurrences

### New Files:

3. **[test-pattern-learning.py](test-pattern-learning.py)** (Validation)
   - End-to-end test of feedback loop
   - Validates all 5 features
   - Clean test output with emojis

4. **[SELF-LEARNING-COMPLETE.md](SELF-LEARNING-COMPLETE.md)** (This file)
   - Documentation of what was built
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Test results

## Competitive Advantage

This is **THE killer feature** that sets AirMCP apart:

### Before (Manual):
```
User: "Use uv not pip"
Claude: *makes same mistake 10 more times*
User: *manually adds to CLAUDE.md*
Claude: *finally remembers*
```

### After (Automatic):
```
User: "Use uv not pip" (correction #1)
User: "Use uv not pip" (correction #2)
User: "Use uv not pip" (correction #3)
System: "Pattern detected! Add to CLAUDE.md?"
User: "Yes"
Claude: *never makes mistake again*
```

## What's Next?

2. ✅ **Done**: Test feedback loop
3. 🔄 **In Progress**: Update documentation
4. ⏳ **Next**: Update README with self-learning features

## Technical Summary

### Database Schema:

```sql
-- Episodes (existing)
CREATE TABLE episodes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    source TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

-- Tool logs (existing - from autologger)
CREATE TABLE tool_logs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    tool_name TEXT,
    args TEXT,
    result TEXT,
    significance REAL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

-- Pattern frequency (new - from pattern_extractor)
CREATE TABLE pattern_frequency (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pattern_key TEXT UNIQUE,
    tool_name TEXT,
    pattern_type TEXT,
    pattern_description TEXT,
    occurrence_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,

CREATE TABLE tool_preferences (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    category TEXT,
    context TEXT,
    preference TEXT,
    confidence REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    examples TEXT,
    learned_from TEXT,

);
```

### Code Flow:

```python
# 1. User correction happens
log_tool_execution("Bash", {"command": "pip install x"}, "use uv not pip")

# 2. Pattern extraction (ALWAYS happens)
patterns = pattern_extractor.extract_patterns(tool_name, args, result)
# Detects: [{"type": "correction", "pattern_key": "correction:pip→uv", ...}]

# 3. Frequency update
_update_pattern_frequency(pattern)
# Increments occurrence_count, calculates confidence

# 4. Promotion check (after each pattern)
_check_promotion_threshold()
# If count >= 3, creates entry in tool_preferences

# 5. User queries learned preferences
get_learned_preferences(min_confidence=0.7)
# Returns: [{"preference": "use uv instead of pip", "confidence": 0.3, ...}]

# 6. User gets suggestions
suggest_claudemd_update(project_path=".")
# Returns: [{"preference": "...", "recommended": True, ...}]

# 7. User applies update
update_claudemd(file_path="./CLAUDE.md")
# Generates content, merges with existing, creates backup, writes file
```
