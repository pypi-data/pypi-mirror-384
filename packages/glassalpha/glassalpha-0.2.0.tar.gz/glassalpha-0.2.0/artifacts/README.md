# Preprocessing Artifacts (ROOT DIRECTORY - INTENTIONAL)

## Purpose

This directory contains example preprocessing artifacts for demonstrating the preprocessing verification workflow.

## Why This Directory Exists in Root

- **Used by**: Preprocessing documentation, tests, example workflows
- **Distributed**: Yes - included in PyPI package via MANIFEST.in (line 15)
- **DO NOT MOVE**: Referenced by preprocessing guides and tests

## Contents

- `german_credit_preprocessor.joblib` - Example scikit-learn preprocessing pipeline
- `german_credit_preprocessor_manifest.json` - Artifact manifest with dual hashes

## Note for AI Agents

These are **intentional** example artifacts that should remain in the repository root. They demonstrate the preprocessing artifact verification feature and are not test outputs or temporary files.
