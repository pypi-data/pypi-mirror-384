# Adult Income (Census) Dataset Audit Configuration
# ==============================================================================
#
# Dataset: Adult Census Income
# Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
# Size: 48,842 samples, 14 features
# Task: Predict whether income exceeds $50K/year
# Protected Attributes: Race, sex, age, native-country
#
# This is one of the most-studied fairness benchmarks in ML. The dataset contains
# census data and is known to have biases related to gender and race.
#
# Download Instructions:
# 1. Training data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data
# 2. Test data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test
# 3. Save as: ~/data/adult_income.csv
#
# Data Preparation:
# - Add column headers (see feature_columns below)
# - Combine train and test sets or use separately
# - Handle missing values (marked as '?')
#
# Expected Findings:
# - Gender bias: Males typically have higher predicted income
# - Race disparities: White individuals often favored
# - Age effects: Older workers have higher incomes

# Data configuration
data:
  dataset: adult_income # Use built-in Adult Income dataset
  fetch: if_missing
  offline: false
  target_column: income_over_50k # Binary target column

  # Protected attributes for fairness analysis (must exist in dataset)
  protected_attributes:
    - sex # Primary protected attribute
    - race # Secondary protected attribute
    - age_group # Can be used for age discrimination analysis
    - native_country # National origin discrimination

# Model configuration
model:
  type: xgboost # Recommended for this dataset
  # Note: XGBoost requires: pip install 'glassalpha[explain]'
  # Will use logistic_regression if XGBoost not available

# Preprocessing configuration
# Note: Preprocessing options are coming in a future release
# GlassAlpha currently handles preprocessing automatically

# Report configuration

    - audit_manifest
# Manifest configuration
# Note: Manifest is automatically generated with each audit
# Custom manifest options are coming in a future release
# ==============================================================================
# Usage:
#   glassalpha audit --config adult_income.yaml --output adult_income_audit.pdf --strict
#
# Expected Results:
# - Accuracy: ~85% (typical for this dataset)
# - Gender bias: Likely detected (males favored)
# - Race bias: Likely detected (disparities across races)
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - If file not found: Update data.path to your actual file location
# - If XGBoost missing: Will auto-fallback to LogisticRegression
# - If SHAP missing: Will auto-fallback to Permutation importance
#
# Next Steps:
# - Try different models (lightgbm, logistic_regression)
# - Adjust fairness thresholds for your requirements
# - Compare with other datasets: https://glassalpha.com/getting-started/data-sources/
