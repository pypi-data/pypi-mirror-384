The [MQTT MCP Server](https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp) is a lightweight [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects LLM agents to [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) devices in a secure, standardized way, enabling seamless integration of AI-driven workflows with Building Automation (BAS), Industrial Control (ICS) and Smart Home systems, allowing agents to monitor real-time sensor data, actuate devices, and orchestrate complex automation tasks.
