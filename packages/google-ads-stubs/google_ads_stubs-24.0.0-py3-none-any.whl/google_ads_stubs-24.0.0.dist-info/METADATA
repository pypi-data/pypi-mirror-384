# Type stubs for the Google Ads API Client Library for Python

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/google-ads-stubs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/google-ads-stubs)

This package provides type stubs for the [Google Ads API Client Library for Python](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-python). 
It's currently compatible with v28.1.0 of this library (v22.0 of the API). It allows you to type check usage of the library with e.g. [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and will also improve autocomplete in many editors.

**This is in no way affiliated with Google.**

Most stubs were created automatically by [stubgen](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html), the rest are handwritten or generated by self-made scripts.

If you find incorrect annotations, please create an issue. Contributions for fixes are also welcome.

## Installation

```
$ pip install google-ads-stubs
```

The stubs should be automatically picked up by your editor or typechecker, but note that if you're using Mypy you need to use the `--namespace-packages` option as `google` and `google.ads` are namespace packages.


## Caveats
The stubs assume the client is constructed with `use_proto_plus=True`. If you use `use_proto_plus=False`, they are unlikely to be of much use to you.

Type inference does _not_ work for the `get_type`
method of `GoogleAdsClient`.The workaround is to explicitly state the type. You can also instantiate the object directly to get inference. 

```python
# Replace this:
campaign_operation = client.get_type('CampaignOperation')
# With this:
from google.ads.googleads.v22.services import CampaignOperation
campaign_operation: CampaignOperation = client.get_type('CampaignOperation')
# Or this:
from google.ads.googleads.v22.services import CampaignOperation
campaign_operation = CampaignOperation()
```
While it is technically possible to type this method using a combination of overloading and literal types,
this is not included in these stubs. The reason is that it requires about 10,000 overloads, which makes most typecheckers fairly slow.

Certain parts of the stubs assume you are using the latest included API version. This includes `GoogleAdsClient.enums` and calls to `GoogleAdsClient.get_type` and `GoogleAdsClient.get_service` without specifying the `version` argument. If you use an older version, you should import enums directly and specify `version` in these calls even if you specified it when constructing the client.

Certain types are too lenient compared to what's allowed at runtime. The first argument to protobuf message constructors accepts any mapping. 
On the other hand certain types are more strict than what's allowed at runtime. You can't substitute a protobuf message for an equivalent dict or an enum with it's equivalent name or value.

```python
# Replace this:
AdGroupAd({
    "status": "ENABLED", 
    "ad": {"type": 2},
})
# With this:
from google.ads.googleads.v22.resources import Ad
from google.ads.googleads.v22.enums import AdGroupAdStatusEnum, AdTypeEnum
AdGroupAd(
    status=AdGroupAdStatusEnum.AdGroupAdStatus.ENABLED, 
    ad=Ad(type=AdTypeEnum.AdType.TEXT_AD),
)
```


## Development
You can run `gen.sh` to generate new stubs, but note that there are a few manual steps before and after mentioned in the script.

Feel free to use this to open a PR when new versions come out.

Contributions to automate the remaining manual steps are also welcome.
