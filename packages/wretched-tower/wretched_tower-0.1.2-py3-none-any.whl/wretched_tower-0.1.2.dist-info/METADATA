## The mechanic

The idea for the mechanic was [originally posted](https://itch.io/jam/wretched-jam/topic/796498/dice-substitute-for-jenga-towers) by user Speak the Sky during a game jam for the SRD.

> Obviously a Jenga tower is a bit more specialised than dice or cards, and can't really been done easily and properly online, so here's a simple mechanic that uses d6s (and an online dice roller like orokos.com):
>
> 1. 1st pull: roll 100(!)d6, take out the 1s,
> 2. 2nd pull: roll the dice you have left, take out the 1s etc.
> 3. 'lose' when you run out of dice.
>
> 100d6 is a lot, which is why you should do this digitally!

## The app

The application is implemented as a TUI which you can access via the command line. It creates a tower,
handles dice rolls on demand, and provides feedback on how close to utter destruction you happen to be.

## Installation

You can install wretched-tower like any other Python application via pip, but you can also sidestep needing to maintain an environment for it by using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```
uvx wretched-tower
```

## Usage

Simply press ++r++ to roll the tower and the display will update.

![Screenshot of the Wretched Tower app in progress, this time showing 47 dice remaining and status Wounded](imgs/Wretched_Tower_2025-03-21T16_29_08_450953.svg)

If you want to start a new tower, press ++ctrl++ + ++n++.
