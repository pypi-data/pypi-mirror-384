=======
[![Build Status](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody/actions/workflows/build-test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody/actions)

[Pynbody](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody) is an analysis framework for
N-body and hydrodynamic astrophysical simulations supporting PKDGRAV/Gasoline,
Gadget, Gadget4/Arepo, N-Chilada and RAMSES AMR outputs. 
Python version support adheres roughly to [SPEC0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).

### Documentation

The documentation is at [readthedocs](https://pynbody.readthedocs.io). To get a first sense of what pynbody
can do, try the [quick-start tutorial](https://pynbody.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/quickstart.html) or
[images tutorial](https://pynbody.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/images.html).


### Getting started

Binary wheels are provided for Linux, MacOS and, from version 2.2, Windows. 

If python and the standard pip package manager is installed and properly configured, you can simply do:

```
$ pip install pynbody
```

If this fails, you may need some more detailed [installation
instructions](https://pynbody.readthedocs.io/latest/installation.html). 

### Contributing

Help us make *pynbody* better! As you develop analysis for your science with pynbody, consider making your code available 
for everyone else to use. You can do this by creating a [tutorial](https://pynbody.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/tutorials.html) 
or by adding your code to the relevant sub-module and submitting a pull request (make a fork first â€” see 
https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).


### Acknowledging the code
