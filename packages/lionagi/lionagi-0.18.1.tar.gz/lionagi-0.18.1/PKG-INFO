           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# LION - Language InterOperable Network

## An AGentic Intelligence SDK

LionAGI is a robust framework for orchestrating multi-step AI operations with
precise control. Bring together multiple models, advanced ReAct reasoning, tool
integrations, and custom validations in a single coherent pipeline.

## Why LionAGI?

- **Structured**: Validate and type all LLM interactions with Pydantic.
- **Expandable**: Integrate multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity,
  custom) with minimal friction.
- **Controlled**: Use built-in safety checks, concurrency strategies, and advanced
  multi-step flows like ReAct.
- **Transparent**: Debug easily with real-time logging, message introspection, and
  tool usage tracking.

## Installation

```
uv add lionagi  # recommended to use pyproject and uv for dependency management

pip install lionagi # or install directly
```

## Quick Start

```python
from lionagi import Branch, iModel

# Pick a model
gpt4o = iModel(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create a Branch (conversation context)
hunter = Branch(
  system="you are a hilarious dragon hunter who responds in 10 words rhymes.",
  chat_model=gpt4o,
)

# Communicate asynchronously
response = await hunter.communicate("I am a dragon")
print(response)
```

```
You claim to be a dragon, oh what a braggin'!
```

### Structured Responses

Use Pydantic to keep outputs structured:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Joke(BaseModel):
    joke: str

res = await hunter.operate(
    instruction="Tell me a short dragon joke",
    response_format=Joke
)
print(type(res))
print(res.joke)
```

```
<class '__main__.Joke'>
With fiery claws, dragons hide their laughter flaws!
```

### ReAct and Tools

LionAGI supports advanced multi-step reasoning with ReAct. Tools let the LLM
invoke external actions:

```
pip install "lionagi[reader]"
```

```python
from lionagi.tools.types import ReaderTool

# Define model first
gpt4o = iModel(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

branch = Branch(chat_model=gpt4o, tools=[ReaderTool])
result = await branch.ReAct(
    instruct={
      "instruction": "Summarize my PDF and compare with relevant papers.",
      "context": {"paper_file_path": "/path/to/paper.pdf"},
    },
    extension_allowed=True,     # allow multi-round expansions
    max_extensions=5,
    verbose=True,      # see step-by-step chain-of-thought
)
print(result)
```

The LLM can now open the PDF, read in slices, fetch references, and produce a
final structured summary.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

LionAGI supports Anthropic's Model Context Protocol for seamless tool integration:

```
pip install "lionagi[mcp]"
```

```python
from lionagi import load_mcp_tools

# Load tools from any MCP server
tools = await load_mcp_tools(".mcp.json", ["search", "memory"])

# Use with ReAct reasoning
branch = Branch(chat_model=gpt4o, tools=tools)
result = await branch.ReAct(
    instruct={"instruction": "Research recent AI developments"},
    tools=["search_exa_search"],
    max_extensions=3
)
```

- **Dynamic Discovery**: Auto-discover and register tools from MCP servers
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation for tool interactions
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource management with automatic reuse

### Observability & Debugging

- Inspect messages:

```python
df = branch.to_df()
print(df.tail())
```

- Action logs show each tool call, arguments, and outcomes.
- Verbose ReAct provides chain-of-thought analysis (helpful for debugging
  multi-step flows).

### Example: Multi-Model Orchestration

```python
from lionagi import Branch, iModel

# Define models for multi-model orchestration
gpt4o = iModel(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")
sonnet = iModel(
  provider="anthropic",
  model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  max_tokens=1000,                    # max_tokens is required for anthropic models
)

branch = Branch(chat_model=gpt4o)
analysis = await branch.communicate("Analyze these stats", chat_model=sonnet) # Switch mid-flow
```

Seamlessly route to different models in the same workflow.

### Claude Code Integration

LionAGI now supports Anthropic's Claude Code [CLI SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk) enabling autonomous coding capabilities with persistent session management. The CLI endpoint
directly connects to claude code, and is recommended, you can either use it via a [proxy server](https://github.com/khive-ai/lionagi/tree/main/cookbooks/claude_proxy) or directly with `query_cli` endpoint, provided you have already logged onto claude code cli in your terminal.

```python
from lionagi import iModel, Branch

def create_cc_model():
  return iModel(
      provider="claude_code",
      endpoint="query_cli",
      model="sonnet",
      verbose_output=True,  # Enable detailed output for debugging
  )

# Start a coding session
orchestrator = Branch(chat_model=create_cc_model())
response = await orchestrator.communicate("Explain the architecture of protocols, operations, and branch")

# continue the session with more queries
response2 = await orchestrator.communicate("how do these parts form lionagi system")
```

### Fan out fan in pattern orchestration with claude code

```python
# use structured outputs with claude code
from lionagi.fields import LIST_INSTRUCT_FIELD_MODEL, Instruct

response3 = await orchestrator.operate(
  instruct=Instruct(
    instruction="create 4 research questions for parallel discovery",
    guidance="put into `instruct_model` field as part of your structured result message",
    context="I'd like to create an orchestration system for AI agents using lionagi"
  ),
  field_models=[LIST_INSTRUCT_FIELD_MODEL],
)

len(response3.instruct_model)  # should be 4

async def handle_instruct(instruct):
  sub_branch = Branch(
    system="You are an diligent research expert.",
    chat_model=create_cc_model(),
  )
  return await sub_branch.operate(instruct=instruct)

# run in parallel across all instruct models
from lionagi.ln import alcall
responses = await alcall(response3.instruct_model, handle_instruct)

# now hand these reports back to the orchestrator
final_response = await orchestrator.communicate(
  "please synthesize these research findings into a final report",
  context=responses,
)
```

Key features:
- **Auto-Resume Sessions**: Conversations automatically continue from where they left off
- **Tool Permissions**: Fine-grained control over which tools Claude can access
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time feedback during code generation
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing LionAGI workflows

### optional dependencies

```
"lionagi[reader]" - Reader tool for any unstructured data and web pages
"lionagi[ollama]" - Ollama model support for local inference
"lionagi[rich]" - Rich output formatting for better console display
"lionagi[schema]" - Convert pydantic schema to make the Model class persistent
"lionagi[postgres]" - Postgres database support for storing and retrieving structured data
