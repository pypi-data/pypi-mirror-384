    shortDescription: This project provides a collection of reusable Python modules designed to support and standardize CI/CD pipeline operations in the jEAP context
    longDescription: >
      The `jeap-python-pipeline-lib` is a Python library that provides reusable modules to facilitate the development
      and management of CI/CD pipelines within the jEAP ecosystem. It aims to standardize operations, enhance efficiency,
      and ensure consistency across various pipeline implementations. As jEAP support multiple CI/CD platforms such
      as Tekton and GitHubActions, the re-use of common scripts and modules is essential to maintain a coherent
      pipeline experience and to reduce duplication of effort across different projects.
    features:
      - Integration of CI/CD pipelines with the jEAP ecosystem (architecture repository service, message contracts, deployment log, test orchestrator)
      - Integration with Pact Broker, Remedy
      - Support for GitOps deployments and automated staging
