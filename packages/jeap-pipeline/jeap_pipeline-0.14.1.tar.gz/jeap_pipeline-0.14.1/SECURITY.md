# jEAP OSS Security Policy

All jEAP Open Source repositories follow the security issue reporting process outlined in
[jeap-admin-ch/SECURITY.md](https://github.com/jeap-admin-ch/jeap/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/jeap-admin-ch/jeap-messaging/security/advisories/new) feature.

The jEAP maintainers will respond with the next steps for handling your report. After the initial reply, the maintainers
will keep you informed about progress toward a fix and public announcement. They may also request additional information
or guidance. Please do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities until we have had the opportunity to investigate and
resolve them.
