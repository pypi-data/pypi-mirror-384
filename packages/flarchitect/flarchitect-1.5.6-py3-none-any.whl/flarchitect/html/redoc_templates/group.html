Grouping fieldstogether allows for more advanced data manipulation and aggregation, similar to the SQL `GROUP BY` clause. This comes in handy when you want to summarise data in a unique way.

### Syntax

To utilise grouping, include the `groupby` query parameter. You can specify just the field name, or use the resource name and field name separated by a dot.

- **Example Single Grouping**: `groupby=field`
- **Example Multiple Grouping with Fields**: `groupby=field1,field2`
- **Example Multiple Grouping with Table and Fields**: `groupby=resource1.field1,resource2.field2`

### Usage

Imagine you are calling an API endpoint, and you want to group by the `{{ base_fields[1] }}` and `{{ base_fields[0] }}` field in the `{{ base_resource }}`

- Your API request would look like this: `&groupby={{ base_resource }}.{{ base_fields[0] }},{{ base_resource }}.{{ base_fields[1] }}`

Or if you have joined `{{ relationship_resource }}` with `{{ base_resource }}`, and you want to group a field from each resource:

- Your API call might be: `&groupby={{ relationship_table }}.{{ relationship_fields[0] }},{{ base_table }}.{{ base_fields[1] }}`

By employing the `groupby` query parameter, you can engage in more sophisticated data analytics, enhancing your ability to understand your dataset.
