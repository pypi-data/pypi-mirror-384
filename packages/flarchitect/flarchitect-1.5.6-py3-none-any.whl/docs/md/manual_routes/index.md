# Manual Routes

flarchitect can wrap your own Flask view functions with the same machinery it
uses for generated endpoints. This is helpful when you handâ€‘craft a route but
still want consistent authentication, schema validation/serialisation, rate
limiting and OpenAPI documentation.
Use `architect.schema_constructor` to decorate a view and describe how it
should be treated. The decorator applies input/output Marshmallow schemas,
honours auth/roles config, attaches rate limiting, and registers the route for
documentation generation.
