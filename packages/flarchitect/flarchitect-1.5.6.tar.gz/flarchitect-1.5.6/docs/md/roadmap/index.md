# Roadmap

- **Enhanced role-based access control** – Add fine-grained permissions and group-based policies to secure endpoints.
- **Real-time updates via WebSockets** – Broadcast model changes to clients for live dashboards and reactive UIs.
- **CLI tooling for project scaffolding** – Generate boilerplate applications and resources from the command line.
- **Plugin architecture** – Allow third-party extensions to hook into requests and responses.
- **First-class caching support** – Integrate an optional caching layer to speed up repeated GET requests.
