# Intro
In flarchitect, configuration options are essential for customising the API and its accompanying documentation.
These settings can be provided through Flask config values or directly within SQLAlchemy model classes using `Meta` classes.
Beyond the basics, the extension supports hooks and advanced flags for post-serialisation callbacks, rate limiting, field exclusion, blueprint naming, endpoint naming via API_ENDPOINT_NAMER <configuration.html#ENDPOINT_NAMER>, soft deletion, and per-method documentation summaries.
Flask config values offer a straightforward, standardised way to modify the extension's behaviour at a global or model level.
