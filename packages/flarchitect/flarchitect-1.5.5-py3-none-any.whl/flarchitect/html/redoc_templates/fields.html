You can customise the API response by specifying which fields you want to be included. This can be useful to minimise the payload or to fetch only the information you need.

To specify fields, include them as a comma-separated list in the query parameter `fields`.

- **Basic Usage**: `fields=id,account,document_number`
- **Advanced Usage with Resource names**: When you perform joins between resources, you can specify which resources field you are referring to by adding the resource name followed by a dot. For example: `fields=resource1.id,resource2.account`

### Syntax

- For fields in the default resource: `fields=field1,field2,field3`
- For fields in specific resources: `fields=resource1.field1,resource2.field2`

**Note**: Resource names are not required for plain API calls. However, if you want to perform joins between resources, specifying the resource names is mandatory.

### Options

You can select from the following list of fields:

{% for field in fields|sort %}
- `{{ field[0] }}` {% if field[1] %}: {{ field[1] }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

These options allow you to create flexible and optimized API queries to suit your specific needs.
