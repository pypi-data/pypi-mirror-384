# High performance Intelligent Preconditioning Operators

## Introduction

HIPO, short for High performance Intelligent Preconditioning Operators, is a large-scale linear equation solver package. It supports distributed heterogeneous parallel computing (MPI+CPU/GPU/DCU/...) and provides physics-informed preconditioners for solvers, especially physics-informed AMG preconditioners. It is dedicated to stably and efficiently solving large-scale linear algebraic equations derived from the discretization of mathematical and physical models.

## Install

``` bash
$ pip install hipo
```

## Usage
use the following command to get the help message:
```bash
$ python -m hipo help
```
copy the example out
```
$ export HIPO_PATH=path_to_hipo
$ cp -r $HIPO_PATH/examples .
```
then run the example:
```bash
$ python solver.py -fnA thermal1.mtx -fnb thermal1_b.mtx solver.json -device cuda:0
```
to run the distributed verison,
```bash

# solve the laplace equation defined by testcase in solver.json
$ $HIPO_PATH/bin/mpirun -n 2 python solver.py solver.json -device cpu

# solve the equation in matrix market format
$ $HIPO_PATH/bin/mpirun -n 2 python solver.py -fnA thermal1.mtx -fnb thermal1_b.mtx solver.json -device cuda:0

```

The following python script shows the above solver.py.
read matrix A and vector b from MatrixMarket files,
using CUDA to solve Ax=b.
```python
# solver.py
import hipo
import sys, re, os
#import json
import commentjson as json

fnA = sys.argv[1]
fnb = sys.argv[2]
config = sys.argv[3]

params = json.load(open(config))

A = hipo.ParCSRMatrix()
A.loadFromFile(fnA)
b = hipo.ParMatrix()
b.loadFromFile(fnb)
if b.getSize() == 0:
    b.resize(A.getRows(), 1)
    b.fill(1)

# transfer the matrix and vector to gpu 0.
dev = hipo.Device("cuda:0")
A = A.toDevice(dev)
b = b.toDevice(dev)

# use gpu 0 to finish the computation.
precond = hipo.createPrecond(params["preconditioner"])
precond.setup(A)
solver = hipo.createSolver(params["solver"])
solver.setup(A)

out = solver.solve(precond, A, b)
```

## Solvers and Preconditioners
use
```bash
$ python -m hipo info
```
to show the builtin solvers, preconditioners, smoothers, level_transfers.


## Compatibility
- ### OS version
HIPO support Linux, Windows.  MacOS version will be available later.

- ### PYTHON version
HIPO support python version 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14. 

- ### GPU/CUDA version
HIPO support NVIDIA GPU, with CUDA Version >= 12.4. 

- ### DCU version
please contact us to compile the specified version.

- ### DISTRIBUTED version
hipo compile with MPICH on linux, and MSMPI on windows. HIPO does not depend on vendor MPI directly, 
but depends on MPI-proxy called hipo_mpi, which is a binary compatible implementation for certern MPI versions.
so you can use you own MPI by compile the hipo_mpi for your MPI version:
```
$ cd $HIPO_PATH/mpi-src
$ bash build.sh
$ cp libhipo_mpi.so $HIPO_PATH/lib/
```
