    """Generates a sequence of SET and MSR instructions with optional WAIT
    instructions between them, where the set values, measurement sizes and
    wait times are randomly selected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value_ranges : dict
        A dictionary where each key is an intervention target to set,
        and each value is a set of possible values it can take.

    n_interventions : int
        The number of intervention cycles
        to perform. Each intervention cycle consists of setting
        values (SET), waiting (WAIT), and measuring (MSR).

    n_msr : int or tuple
        The number of measurements to take in each measurement
        phase. If a tuple, it defines a range of possible numbers to
        randomly sample from.

    repeat : bool, optional
        If True, allows the repetition of the same value for
        subsequent interventions for the same target. If False, each
        intervention for a target must have a different value from the
        last. Default is False.

    wait_before_set : int or tuple, optional
        The waiting time (in milliseconds) before setting values in
        each intervention. If a tuple, it defines a range of possible
        wait times to randomly sample from. Default is 0, meaning no
        WAIT instruction is produced.

    wait_before_msr : int or tuple, optional
        The waiting time (in milliseconds) before measuring after each
        intervention. If a tuple, it defines a range of possible wait
        times to randomly sample from. Default is 0, meaning no WAIT
        instruction is produced.

    random_state : int, optional
        A seed value for the random number generator to ensure
        reproducibility. Default is 42.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        A list of strings, each representing an instruction.

    Notes
    -----

    - The function internally uses a random number generator for
      selecting wait times, values to set, and the number of
      measurements.
    - The 'SET' instructions are generated based on the `value_ranges`
      and the `repeat` parameter.
    - The function ensures that each target is set exactly once in
      each intervention cycle.
