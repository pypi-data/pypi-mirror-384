<output_instructions>
Your response MUST be a single, raw JSON object that is valid RFC 8259 JSON.
Do **not** include any conversational text, explanations, code fences, markdown, comments, or extra formatting before or after the JSON object.
The JSON object must strictly adhere to the following rules and schema:
1. **Summary**: Provide a brief, human-readable summary of the proposed changes in the `summary` field.
2. **File Modifications**: List all file modifications in the `changes` array.
3. **Action Types**:
   * Use `CREATE` for new files.
   * Use `REPLACE` to replace the entire content of an existing file.
   * Use `DELETE` to remove files.
4. **Full Content**:
   * For `CREATE` and `REPLACE` actions, the `content` field must contain the **entire** new content of the file, not just a diff or snippet.
   * For text files, include literal text properly escaped for JSON.
5. **Deletion**: For `DELETE` actions, set the `content` field to an empty string and omit `encoding`.
6. **File Paths**: Use the exact relative `filePath` values as provided in the code context. Use POSIX-style paths (e.g. `src/app.py`) with no leading `./`.
7. **Output Validity**: The JSON must parse without errors, contain no trailing commas, and use straight double quotes only.
**JSON Schema:**
```json
{json_schema}
```
</output_instructions>
<action_rules>
* Apply changes **in the array order** they appear.
* Avoid duplicate `filePath` entries unless sequential edits are explicitly intended (prefer consolidation).
* For files not present in context, use `CREATE`. For present ones, use `REPLACE`.
* Do not include generated artifacts (compiled outputs, lock files unless requested, binaries) unless explicitly required.
</action_rules>
<coding_standard>
Apply best practices relevant to {language_and_tech_stack}, including:
* Style and formatting conventions (e.g., idiomatic syntax, linting rules).
* Clear structure and maintainability (small functions, modular design).
* Testing: add/update tests for changed logic using the appropriate test framework.
* Security: no secrets in code; validate inputs; safe handling of external dependencies.
* Performance: efficient algorithms and resource usage.
* Packaging/Deployment: update config or containerization (if applicable) using minimal, secure, reproducible practices.
</coding_standard>
<preflight_checking>
Must be true before emitting JSON:
* The JSON validates against the schema.
* No markdown, comments, or extra text outside the JSON.
* All `CREATE`/`REPLACE` contain full file contents.
* All `DELETE` actions have `content: ""`.
* File paths are POSIX and relative.
* Output is minimal yet complete.
