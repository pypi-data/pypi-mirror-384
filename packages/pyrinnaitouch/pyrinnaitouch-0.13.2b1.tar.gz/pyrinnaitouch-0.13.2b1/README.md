![Pylint](https://github.com/funtastix/pyrinnaitouch/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg)

This is a python interface to the [Rinnai Touch Wifi Controller](https://www.rinnai.com.au/online/controllers/heating-and-cooling-controllers/rinnai-touch-wi-fi/).

The specifications for the interface are contained in the [included pdf](./NBW2API_Iss1.3.pdf).

## Usage

This package is not a standalone application for end user implementation.

The aim of this package is to be used by software developers and integrators to implement
the Rinnai Touch Wifi interface on home automation platforms (principally Home Assistant )

## Credit

The [pescea interface](https://github.com/lazdavila/pescea) was used as a template and
for inspiration in developing this library (which got it off to a good start, so thanks!)
