    "text": "grep — print lines that match patterns\n\nBrief:\n- grep searches for lines matching a given pattern in files or standard input.\n- Supports powerful regular expressions to filter text.\n\nSyntax:\n- grep \"pattern\" file.txt\n- grep -R \"main\" ./src          # recursive search\n- grep -n \"error\" app.log       # show line numbers\n- grep -i \"warning\" file.txt    # case-insensitive\n- grep -E \"foo|bar\" file.txt    # extended regex (egrep)\n\nExamples:\n- dmesg | grep -i usb\n- grep -R \"TODO\" .\n\nTips:\n- Use -R for recursive, -n for line numbers, -i for case-insensitive.\n- Pipe other commands into grep to filter output.\n- For large codebases, consider ripgrep (rg) for speed.\n"
