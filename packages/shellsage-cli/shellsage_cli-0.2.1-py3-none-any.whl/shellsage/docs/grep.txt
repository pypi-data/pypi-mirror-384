grep â€” print lines that match patterns

Brief:
- grep searches for lines matching a given pattern in files or standard input.
- Supports powerful regular expressions to filter text.

Syntax:
- grep "pattern" file.txt
- grep -R "main" ./src          # recursive search
- grep -n "error" app.log       # show line numbers
- grep -i "warning" file.txt    # case-insensitive
- grep -E "foo|bar" file.txt    # extended regex (egrep)

Examples:
- dmesg | grep -i usb
- grep -R "TODO" .

Tips:
- Use -R for recursive, -n for line numbers, -i for case-insensitive.
- Pipe other commands into grep to filter output.
- For large codebases, consider ripgrep (rg) for speed.
