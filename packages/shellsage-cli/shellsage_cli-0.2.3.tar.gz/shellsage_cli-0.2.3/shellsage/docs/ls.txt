ls — list directory contents

Brief:
- The ls command lists files and directories in the current or specified path.
- Commonly used to quickly inspect what is inside a folder.

Syntax:
- ls
- ls -l            # long listing with permissions, owner, size, and date
- ls -a            # include hidden files (those starting with .)
- ls -la           # long listing + hidden files
- ls -lh           # long listing with human-readable sizes (KB, MB)

Examples:
- ls -la /var/log
- ls -lh ~/Downloads

Tips:
- Combine -l with -h for easier reading of file sizes.
- Use --color=auto for colored output in many shells.
- On macOS, consider -G for color if --color isn’t available.
