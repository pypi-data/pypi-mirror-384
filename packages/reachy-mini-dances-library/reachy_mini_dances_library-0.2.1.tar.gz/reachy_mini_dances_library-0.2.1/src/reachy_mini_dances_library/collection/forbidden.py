"""Forbidden and Experimental Moves, use with caution.

--------------------------------------
This module contains experimental and diagnostic moves that are not part of
the main, curated library. These moves may be unstable, highly specialized,
or intended for specific tests.

Use them with caution as these could damage the robot.
They are not included in the default `AVAILABLE_MOVES`
registry and must be imported explicitly.
