ABOUT: |
    Magnesium aluminium oxide, commonly known as spinel (MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), is a transparent ceramic material with a cubic crystal structure. Spinel possesses excellent optical transparency from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared range, making it valuable for various optical applications. This material is notably durable, resistant to attack from harsh environments, and can withstand high temperatures. These characteristics make it ideal for protective windows in specific high-stress applications. Moreover, due to its favorable mechanical properties and refractive index, spinel is being considered for anti-reflective coatings and other advanced optical devices. Additionally, its non-birefringent nature is a plus in certain optical scenarios.
