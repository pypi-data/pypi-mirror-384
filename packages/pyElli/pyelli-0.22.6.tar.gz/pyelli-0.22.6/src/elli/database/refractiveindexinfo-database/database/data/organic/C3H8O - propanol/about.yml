ABOUT: |
    Propanol (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O), also commonly referred to as propyl alcohol, comes in two isomeric forms: n-propanol (or 1-propanol) and isopropanol (or 2-propanol). These alcohols are clear, colorless liquids that are miscible with water and have a characteristic alcoholic odor. Both forms of propanol are used as solvents in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and chemical industries. n-Propanol is often employed in the manufacture of antiseptics, detergents, and disinfectants, whereas isopropanol, popularly known as rubbing alcohol, is used for its antiseptic properties and as a cleaning agent. In optics, the refractive properties of propanol can be explored when it's used as a medium or in conjunction with other materials to modify light behavior.
