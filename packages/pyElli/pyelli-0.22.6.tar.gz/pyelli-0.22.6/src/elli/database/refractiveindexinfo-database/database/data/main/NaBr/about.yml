ABOUT: |
    Sodium bromide (NaBr) is a white crystalline solid commonly used in various applications. In its pure form, it can be processed into clear crystalline windows or pieces, showcasing transparency not just in the visible range but also extensively into the infrared spectrum. This characteristic transparency in the infrared region is particularly beneficial, making NaBr an invaluable material in infrared spectroscopy and other related optical applications.
