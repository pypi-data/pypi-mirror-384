ABOUT: |
    Iron(II,III) oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), also known as magnetite, is a black, magnetic mineral with multiple applications, including in the field of optics. It possesses unique magnetic properties that make it ideal for magneto-optical recording and sensing technologies. The material's interaction with light can be modified by external magnetic fields, providing a platform for tunable optical devices. Additionally, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles have garnered attention for use in photothermal therapy, owing to their capacity to absorb near-infrared radiation and convert it to heat. This compound combines magnetic and optical functionalities, offering a unique palette of features for contemporary optical research and applications.
    
    Minerals: Magnetite, Lodestone (naturally magnetized magnetite).
