ABOUT: |
    Xylene (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) is a volatile organic compound consisting of a benzene ring with two methyl groups (-CH<sub>3</sub>) attached. It is typically found as a clear, colorless liquid possessing a sweet, aromatic odor reminiscent of gasoline. Xylene is primarily used as a solvent in the printing, rubber, and leather industries and is also a key ingredient in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics and polyester fibers. In optical applications, xylene's unique refractive properties may make it useful for specific purposes. However, xylene is known to be a potent neurotoxin and exposure can lead to significant health risks, necessitating stringent safety measures during use and handling.
