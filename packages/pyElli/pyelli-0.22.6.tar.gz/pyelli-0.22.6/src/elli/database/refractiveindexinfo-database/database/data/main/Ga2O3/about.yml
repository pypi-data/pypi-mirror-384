ABOUT: |
    Gallium oxide (Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a white or transparent crystalline material that has garnered significant attention in the optoelectronic industry due to its wide bandgap and excellent thermal stability. Its wide bandgap of approximately 4.8 eV makes it an appealing candidate for ultraviolet photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. Gallium oxide's high thermal and chemical stability also position it as a promising material for high-power electronic applications. Additionally, its high transparency in the visible to far-ultraviolet spectrum offers utility in various optical applications such as transparent conductive layers in optoelectronic devices. Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is often synthesized via methods like chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, and its properties can be tuned for specific optical applications.
