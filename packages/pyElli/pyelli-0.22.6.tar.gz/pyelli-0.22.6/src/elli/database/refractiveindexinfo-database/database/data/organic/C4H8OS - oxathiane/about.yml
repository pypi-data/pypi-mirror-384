ABOUT: |
    Oxathiane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>OS) is an organosulfur compound, specifically a cyclic thiocarbonate. It contains a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, and four carbon atoms. As a relatively less-known compound in comparison to more common organosulfur compounds, its applications are specialized and niche. Liquid at room temperature, oxathiane exhibits the typical sulfurous odor associated with many sulfur-containing organic compounds. When studying its optical properties, researchers often focus on its interactions with light and potential uses in various organic synthesis processes or optoelectronic applications. Handling and storage of oxathiane, like many organic substances, should be done with care to avoid any hazardous reactions.
    
    Isomers: 1,4-Oxathiane (p-Oxathiane) - most important isomer; 1,3-Oxathiane (m-Oxathiane); 1,2-Oxathiane (o-Oxathiane).
