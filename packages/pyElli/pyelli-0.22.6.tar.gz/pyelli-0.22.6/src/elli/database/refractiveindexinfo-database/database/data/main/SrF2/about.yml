ABOUT: |
    Strontium fluoride (SrF<sub>2</sub>) is an inorganic compound that appears as a white crystalline solid at room temperature. With a high melting point and good thermal stability, it is often used in optical applications due to its notable transparency to ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Its optical clarity has led to its use in the manufacture of windows and lenses, especially in specialized optical systems. Additionally, SrF<sub>2</sub> is employed as a thin film in the production of optical coatings, thanks to its low refractive index. Moreover, the compound is explored for potential use in fluoride ion batteries due to its high ionic conductivity. In nature, strontium fluoride occurs as the mineral strontianite, though most commercial preparations are synthesized through chemical reactions.
