ABOUT: |
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, or bismuth telluride, is a layered compound with a rhombohedral crystal structure, renowned for its thermoelectric properties and significant role in energy conversion applications. It is a topological insulator that exhibits unique electronic states on its surface while being insulating in its bulk. In optics, Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> is recognized for its high refractive index and strong optical anisotropy, stemming from its layered structure. The material's narrow bandgap and excellent carrier mobility make it suitable for infrared photodetectors, modulators, and other optoelectronic devices. Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> can be synthesized using techniques such as zone melting, Bridgman-Stockbarger, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, it is sensitive to environmental conditions, necessitating protective measures to preserve its optical and electronic properties. This material continues to be a subject of intense research for applications in thermoelectrics, photonics, and quantum technology.
