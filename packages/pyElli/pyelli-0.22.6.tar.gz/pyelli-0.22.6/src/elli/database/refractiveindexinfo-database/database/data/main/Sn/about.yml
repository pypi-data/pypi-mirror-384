ABOUT: |
    Tin (Sn) is a malleable, silvery-white metal that has been used by humans for thousands of years. Historically significant for its role in the production of bronze, an alloy of tin and copper, it ushered in the Bronze Age. Modern applications are diverse, from tin plating, which involves coating other metals with tin to prevent corrosion, to its use as a major component in solder for joining electrical components. Another critical application of tin is in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, where tin droplets are used as targets to produce EUV light, vital for next-generation semiconductor manufacturing. Additionally, due to its non-toxic nature, tin is used as a protective coating in food packaging like tin cans. Its compounds, such as tin(II) oxide, also find applications in ceramics and other industries.
