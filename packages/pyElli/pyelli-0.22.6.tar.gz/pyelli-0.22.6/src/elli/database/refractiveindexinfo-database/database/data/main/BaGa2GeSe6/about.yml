ABOUT: |
    BaGa<sub>2</sub>GeSe<sub>6</sub> (BGGSe) is a nonlinear optical crystal known for its wide transparency range and phase-matching capabilities in the mid-infrared region. It is particularly effective for frequency conversion applications, such as optical parametric oscillation, due to its high nonlinear optical coefficients. The material's broad phase-matching range and wide transparency window make it ideal for tunable laser systems operating in the mid-infrared spectrum. BGGSe also exhibits a high laser damage threshold, which makes it suitable for high-power applications. However, like many other chalcogenide crystals, it can be sensitive to moisture and requires careful handling and storage to maintain its optical quality. The crystal is typically grown using the Bridgman technique and can be polished into high-quality facets for optimal performance. Overall, BaGa<sub>2</sub>GeSe<sub>6</sub> (BGGSe) represents a compelling option for nonlinear optical applications requiring a broad tunability and high power-handling capacity in the mid-infrared region.
