ABOUT: |
    Iron sesquioxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), also known as ferric oxide or hematite, is a reddish-brown compound with various applications across industries. In optics, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is often used as a pigment in coatings and materials that require specific absorption or scattering properties. Its optically active properties have also made it a subject of study for photonic and plasmonic applications, particularly in the development of sensors and imaging technologies. Thin films of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> have been investigated for use in optoelectronic devices and waveguides. While not a traditional optical material, iron sesquioxide provides specific characteristics beneficial to specialized optical applications and research.
    
    Minerals: Hematite (haematite), Maghemite.
