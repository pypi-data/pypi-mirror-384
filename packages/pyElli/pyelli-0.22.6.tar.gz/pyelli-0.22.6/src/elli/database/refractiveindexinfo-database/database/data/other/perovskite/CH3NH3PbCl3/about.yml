ABOUT: |
    Methylammonium lead chloride (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbCl<sub>3</sub>) is a key perovskite material, noted for its use in optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This compound displays a cubic crystal structure, contributing to its unique optical properties, including a high refractive index and excellent photoluminescence. The presence of chloride tends to enhance the material's stability compared to its iodide counterpart, though it still contains lead, raising concerns about its environmental safety.
    
    The optical characteristics of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbCl<sub>3</sub> are significant for the development of light-based technologies, yet its commercial viability is tempered by issues related to durability and toxicity.
