ABOUT: |
    Nickel phosphorus trisulfide (NiPS<sub>3</sub>) is a member of the transition metal phosphorus trisulfides, a group of layered materials with interesting magnetic and electronic properties. NiPS<sub>3</sub> is known for its antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures, which is a subject of significant interest in the field of spintronics and magnetic memory devices. Structurally, it belongs to the category of van der Waals materials, which allows for exfoliation into thin layers or flakes, offering opportunities for exploring two-dimensional material physics. In terms of electronic properties, NiPS<sub>3</sub> exhibits semiconducting behavior with an indirect bandgap, making it a potential candidate for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. The study of its optical properties, including the refractive index, is key to understanding and exploiting its interaction with light. Knowledge of the refractive index of NiPS<sub>3</sub> across various wavelengths is essential for the design and fabrication of optoelectronic devices, where precise manipulation of light is required. Ongoing research into the optical characteristics of NiPS<sub>3</sub> is critical for unlocking its full potential in technological applications.
