ABOUT: |
    Thallium bromide (TlBr) is a crystalline compound with interesting properties that make it suitable for radiation detection applications. It possesses a wide bandgap and high atomic numbers for both thallium and bromine, characteristics that enhance its performance as a gamma-ray detector. Additionally, TlBr detectors exhibit high energy resolution and are suitable for high-temperature operations. Due to its potential in radiation detection, TlBr has attracted attention in the field of nuclear medicine and security. However, the material's long-term stability and potential toxicity from thallium content require careful consideration during usage and handling.
