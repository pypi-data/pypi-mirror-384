ABOUT: |
    Rhenium disulfide (ReSe<sub>2</sub>) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide with unique electronic and optical properties. Unlike other members of the transition metal dichalcogenide family, ReSe<sub>2</sub> possesses a distorted 1T structure, which gives rise to its distinctive anisotropic properties. It is known for its strong in-plane anisotropy, both in its electronic and optical behaviors, making it intriguing for potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. This material can be exfoliated into ultrathin layers, similar to graphene, allowing for investigations and applications in the realm of two-dimensional materials. ReSe<sub>2</sub> has been studied for its potential use in field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and other nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.
