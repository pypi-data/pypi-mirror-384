    300 ns. Four-wave mixing. Relative measurement (to GaAs). The authors mistakenly used an incorrect value of n<sub>2</sub> of GaAs when converting a relative measurement to an absolute value. They used 4.0e-19 cm<sup>2</sup>/W instead of 4.0e-14 cm<sup>2</sup>/W, which was cited earlier in the same paper. The database now includes a recalculated value using n<sub>2</sub>(GaAs) = 4.0e-14 cm<sup>2</sup>/W.
