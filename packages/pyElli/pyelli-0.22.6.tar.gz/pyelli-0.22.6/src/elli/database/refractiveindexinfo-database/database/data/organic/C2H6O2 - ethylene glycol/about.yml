ABOUT: |
    Ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) is a colorless, flammable gas with a slightly sweet odor. It is the simplest alkene and is produced in vast quantities in the petrochemical industry. Ethylene plays a critical role in the synthetic polymer industry, being the precursor to polyethylene, the world's most widely used plastic. Besides its significance in polymer synthesis, ethylene is a naturally occurring plant hormone responsible for fruit ripening and flower wilting. Due to its importance in both industrial and natural processes, ethylene production and its role in plant biology have been extensively studied. In the industrial setting, it's crucial to store and transport ethylene under controlled conditions due to its flammability.
