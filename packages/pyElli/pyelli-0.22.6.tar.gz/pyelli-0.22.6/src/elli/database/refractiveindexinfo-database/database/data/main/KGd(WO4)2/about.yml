ABOUT: |
    Potassium gadolinium tungstate, commonly abbreviated as KGW (KGd(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), is a nonlinear optical crystal with notable properties for laser frequency conversion. Known for its high damage threshold and broad transparency range, KGW is widely employed in solid-state laser systems. It is an effective medium for second harmonic generation (SHG) and can be used for generating high-intensity, high-frequency laser beams. KGW also exhibits good thermal conductivity and is stable in moist conditions, adding to its desirability for various optical applications. In summary, its unique optical and thermal properties make KGW a highly valuable material in laser technology.
