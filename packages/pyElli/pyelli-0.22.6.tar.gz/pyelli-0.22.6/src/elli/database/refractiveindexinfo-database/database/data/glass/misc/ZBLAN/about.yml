  - ZBLAN fluoride glass

ABOUT: |
    ZBLAN is a type of heavy-metal fluoride glass composed primarily of zirconium, barium, lanthanum, aluminum, and sodium fluorides. It is distinguished by its exceptional transmission capabilities in the mid-infrared range, often far superior to that of silica-based glasses. ZBLAN glass is renowned for its low levels of optical scattering, low refractive index variations, and low optical losses, making it an ideal material for fiber-optic applications, especially for those operating in the infrared spectrum. It also boasts a broad transmission window, from the ultraviolet through to the mid-infrared, and is often used in applications like spectroscopy, laser transmission, and sensing where these properties offer distinct advantages. However, ZBLAN can be challenging to manufacture and work with due to its sensitivity to impurities and crystallization. Despite these challenges and its relatively high cost, the unique optical properties of ZBLAN make it indispensable for specialized applications where conventional optical materials fall short.
