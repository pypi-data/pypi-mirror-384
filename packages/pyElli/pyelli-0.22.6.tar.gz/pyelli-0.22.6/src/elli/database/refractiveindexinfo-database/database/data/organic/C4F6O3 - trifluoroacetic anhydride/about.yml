ABOUT: |
    Trifluoroacetic anhydride ((CF<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O) is a powerful acylating agent used extensively in organic synthesis to introduce trifluoroacetyl groups into various substrates. This compound is a colorless, highly reactive liquid with a strong, pungent odor. It is especially valuable in peptide synthesis and other sensitive chemical processes where its reactivity and volatility facilitate the formation and manipulation of complex molecules. While Trifluoroacetic anhydride is not primarily recognized for its optical properties, its potential for use in specific scientific analyses involving fluorinated compounds could be considered in specialized settings.
