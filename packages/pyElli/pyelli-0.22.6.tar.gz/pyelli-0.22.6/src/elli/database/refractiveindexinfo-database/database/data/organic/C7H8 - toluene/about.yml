ABOUT: |
    Toluene (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) is a clear, colorless liquid with a distinctive, pungent odor reminiscent of paint thinners. It is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon, found at low concentrations in crude oil and is a major component of gasoline. Toluene is widely used as an industrial solvent for paints, coatings, adhesives, and other applications. Furthermore, it serves as an important precursor in the synthesis of a variety of chemicals, especially benzene, xylenes, and a range of polymers and resins. Due to its refractive qualities, it can be of interest in optical studies. While it has various industrial and chemical applications, toluene is also known to have neurotoxic effects and can be harmful if inhaled in large quantities. Proper care should be taken when working with this compound.
