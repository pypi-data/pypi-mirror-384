ABOUT: |
    Lithium fluoride (LiF) is a simple ionic compound commonly used in optics and radiation detection. It is transparent over a broad spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths. This characteristic makes it an ideal material for specialized UV and IR windows and lenses. It also serves as a mount for samples to be studied by X-ray crystallography. One of its notable features is its high resistance to radiation damage, making it useful in environments with high-energy radiation. However, it is relatively soft and is moisture-sensitive, requiring careful handling to maintain its optical properties.
