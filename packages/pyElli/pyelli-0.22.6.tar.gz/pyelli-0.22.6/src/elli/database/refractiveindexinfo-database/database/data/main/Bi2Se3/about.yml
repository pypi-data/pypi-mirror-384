ABOUT: |
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, or bismuth selenide, is a layered compound with a rhombohedral crystal structure that has gained significant attention for its topological insulator properties. This material exhibits unique electronic states on its surface, while behaving as an insulator in its bulk. In the realm of optics, Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> has shown promise for applications in photodetectors, modulators, and even as a platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. It has a high refractive index and exhibits strong optical anisotropy due to its layered crystal structure. Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> also has a narrow bandgap and shows strong photoresponse across a broad spectrum, making it suitable for infrared applications. While the material can be synthesized through methods such as Bridgman-Stockbarger and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), it is somewhat sensitive to environmental conditions and may require protective coatings to maintain its properties. Overall, Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> is a fascinating material that has captivated researchers for its intriguing electronic and optical characteristics, holding promise for future applications in optoelectronics and quantum computing.
