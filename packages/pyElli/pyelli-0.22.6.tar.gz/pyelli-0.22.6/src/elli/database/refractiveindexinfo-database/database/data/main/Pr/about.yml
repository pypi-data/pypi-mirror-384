ABOUT: |
    Praseodymium (Pr) is a soft, silvery, malleable, and ductile metal that belongs to the lanthanide series of the periodic table. While not as abundant as some other rare earth elements, praseodymium is still found in significant quantities in certain minerals, such as monazite and bastn√§site. In terms of its optical properties, praseodymium is often utilized in the creation of certain types of yellow and green glasses and ceramics, which can absorb ultraviolet light. Additionally, praseodymium-doped fibers have been explored in the realm of fiber optics for their potential use in amplifiers. The metal can also be found in alloys, where it is used to produce high-strength metals that are used in aircraft engines.
