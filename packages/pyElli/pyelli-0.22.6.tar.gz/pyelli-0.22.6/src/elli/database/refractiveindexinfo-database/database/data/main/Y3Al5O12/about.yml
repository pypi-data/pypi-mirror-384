ABOUT: |
    Yttrium aluminium garnet (Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, YAG) is a synthetic crystalline material frequently employed in a variety of applications. It possesses a unique combination of high thermal stability, mechanical robustness, and optical clarity, making it particularly desirable for high-performance environments. In the realm of optics and photonics, YAG is often used as the host crystal in solid-state lasers, most notably the Nd:YAG laser where the YAG crystal is doped with neodymium. These lasers are employed in a range of settings, from medical procedures to material processing. Additionally, undoped YAG is a common substrate for various thin-film applications, given its compatibility with high-temperature deposition processes. In the lighting sector, YAG, when doped with cerium, is used as a phosphor in white LED technology.
