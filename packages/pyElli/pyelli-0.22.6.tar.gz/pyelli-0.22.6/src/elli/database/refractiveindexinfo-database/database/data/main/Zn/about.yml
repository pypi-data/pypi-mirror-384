ABOUT: |
    Zinc (Zn) is a bluish-white, lustrous metal that belongs to group 12 of the periodic table. Essential in small amounts for human health, zinc plays a vital role in numerous biological processes and is an essential trace element. Industrially, it is primarily used for galvanizing steel to prevent rusting, an application that consumes over half of the global production. Zinc is also used in the production of many alloys such as brass, bronze, and various solders. In the realm of optics, zinc can be found as an essential component in some glass formulations due to its ability to increase the refractive index. Moreover, it is a semiconducting material employed in photovoltaic applications and the production of zinc oxide (ZnO), which has uses ranging from sunscreens to electronics.
