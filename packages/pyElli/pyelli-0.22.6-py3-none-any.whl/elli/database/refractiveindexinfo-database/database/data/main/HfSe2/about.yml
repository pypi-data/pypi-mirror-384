ABOUT: |
    Hafnium diselenide (HfSe<sub>2</sub>) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide known for its intriguing electronic and optical properties. It crystallizes in a hexagonal structure, akin to other materials in its class, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>). Notably, HfSe<sub>2</sub> exhibits a narrow indirect bandgap, which makes it a subject of interest for semiconductor applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Its layered nature allows for exfoliation into thin films or even monolayers, providing a platform for exploring two-dimensional material physics and enabling potential applications in flexible and transparent devices. In addition to its electronic properties, HfSe<sub>2</sub> has been studied for its thermal stability and mechanical strength, which further enhance its appeal in various technological applications. However, the optical properties, particularly its refractive index, are less explored compared to its electronic characteristics. The refractive index of HfSe<sub>2</sub> is crucial for designing optical components like waveguides and photodetectors, where precise control over light-matter interaction is essential. As research in this material progresses, understanding and tabulating its refractive index across different wavelengths will provide valuable insights for both fundamental studies and practical applications.
