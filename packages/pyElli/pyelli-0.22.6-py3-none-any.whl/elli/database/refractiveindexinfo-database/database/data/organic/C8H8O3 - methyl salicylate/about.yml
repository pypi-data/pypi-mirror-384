ABOUT: |
    Methyl salicylate (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is an organic ester that is naturally produced by many species of plants, particularly wintergreens. It has a minty aroma and is used as a flavoring agent in some products. Medically, it's employed as a counterirritant in topical analgesics to relieve minor body aches and pains. In the field of optics, its transparent characteristics can be beneficial in various applications. However, care should be taken in its use, as it is toxic when ingested in large amounts.
