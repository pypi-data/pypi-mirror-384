ABOUT: |
    Styrene (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) is a colorless to yellowish organic compound that exists as a liquid with a distinctive sweet smell, though its odor can be sharp and unpleasant in higher concentrations. It is an essential monomer used in the production of polystyrene, a versatile plastic. Styrene polymerizes readily; this property has led to its widespread use in producing a variety of polymer materials. Styrene can be found in various consumer products, such as food containers and packaging materials. In addition to its role in plastics, styrene's refractive properties are of interest in the optical domain. Prolonged exposure to its vapors should be avoided as it is considered a potential human carcinogen and can affect the central nervous system.
