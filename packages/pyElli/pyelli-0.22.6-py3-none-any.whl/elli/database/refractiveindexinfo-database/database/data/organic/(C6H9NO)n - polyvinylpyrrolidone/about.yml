ABOUT: |
    Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO)<sub>n</sub>) is a water-soluble polymer made from the monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone. This polymer has found its way into a myriad of applications due to its unique properties such as excellent solubility in water and many organic solvents, capability to form films, and adhesive qualities. In the pharmaceutical industry, PVP is employed as a binder in tablet formulations, and in cosmetics, it's often used as a stabilizer and emulsifier. In the optics realm, PVP solutions can be used for spin coating to form thin films. Additionally, its hygroscopic nature allows it to be employed as a moisture-absorbing agent in many products. One notable property of PVP is its capability to form complexes with various compounds, enhancing the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, leading to its common use in the pharmaceutical sector.
