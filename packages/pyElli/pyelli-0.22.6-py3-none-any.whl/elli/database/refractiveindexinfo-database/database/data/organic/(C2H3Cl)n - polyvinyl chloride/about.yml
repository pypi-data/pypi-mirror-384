ABOUT: |
    Polyvinyl chloride (PVC, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl)<sub>n</sub>) is one of the most extensively produced synthetic polymers globally. Predominantly known for its durability, resistance to environmental degradation, and versatility, PVC is commonly used in a wide range of products, including piping, cables, clothing, furniture, signage, and various medical devices. In terms of optics, PVC's transparency can be manipulated based on the addition of plasticizers, stabilizers, and other additives, enabling it to be used in applications like transparent films or sheets. However, its inherent chlorine content can render PVC less transparent than other polymers unless adequately treated or modified. PVC exists in both rigid and flexible forms, with flexible PVC often containing significant amounts of plasticizers to impart pliability. While PVC has numerous advantages, it is also a subject of environmental and health concerns, especially when it comes to disposal and potential release of toxic chlorine compounds.
