ABOUT: |
    Pentanediol (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an organic compound primarily used in the industrial production of polymers and as a solvent in various chemical reactions. It belongs to the family of diols, which are alcohols with two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. Pentanediol can exist in multiple isomeric forms depending on the position of the hydroxyl groups in the molecule. In the realm of optics, it's relatively transparent in the visible range. Like other organic solvents, it's important to handle pentanediol with care, considering its potential reactivity and health effects. Safe storage and handling measures should be adhered to, especially when used in significant quantities.
    
    Isomers:1,5-Pentanediol - most common isomer; 2,4-Pentanediol; 1,2-Pentanediol.
    
    Chemical formula:
    1,5-Pentanediol: HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH
