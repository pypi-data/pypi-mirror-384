ABOUT: |
    Silicon carbide (SiC) is a robust and hard compound characterized by its high thermal conductivity, high electric field breakdown strength, and high power frequency. Its hardness is second only to diamond, which makes it an ideal material for abrasive applications. SiC possesses excellent thermal stability, allowing it to maintain its structural integrity in high-temperature environments. As a result, it is commonly used in power electronics, especially in high voltage devices, due to its ability to operate at high temperatures. In the realm of optoelectronics, SiC serves as a substrate for LED production, given its beneficial bandgap properties. Furthermore, its thermal and chemical resistance has made it a favored material in automotive applications, specifically for brake discs. In recent years, its transparent nature in some infrared spectra has led to research into its use for transparent armor and windows. Its unique combination of electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties position SiC as a pivotal material for various high-performance applications.
