ABOUT: |
    Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is an inorganic compound with a hexagonal wurtzite structure or a cubic zincblende structure, depending on the conditions under which it is synthesized. This material has been widely studied for its semiconducting and optoelectronic properties, specifically its use in photodetectors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes. With a direct bandgap that ranges from approximately 2.4 to 2.5 eV, CdS is highly transparent in the visible range and can absorb ultraviolet light, making it suitable for various optical applications. Its high electron mobility and good thermal stability further extend its utility in electronic devices. However, cadmium is a toxic element, which places constraints on the material's handling and environmental impact. Methods for synthesizing CdS include chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, and various solution-based approaches like sol-gel and hydrothermal methods. Despite the toxicity challenges, CdS remains a pivotal material in the realm of semiconductors and optoelectronics, and it continues to be a subject of extensive research to mitigate its environmental impact while leveraging its advantageous properties.
