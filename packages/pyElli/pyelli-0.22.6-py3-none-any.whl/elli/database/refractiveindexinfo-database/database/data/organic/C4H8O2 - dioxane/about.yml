ABOUT: |
    Dioxane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a clear, colorless organic solvent with a faint pleasant odor. It is used in a variety of industrial and scientific applications due to its miscibility with both water and many organic solvents. Dioxane is commonly used as a solvent for cellulose, resins, oils, and fats. In laboratories, it's often employed in organic synthesis and as a solvent in spectroscopic studies. It is also utilized in the preparation of certain pharmaceuticals. However, dioxane is classified as a potential human carcinogen and its use and disposal are subject to strict regulations in many countries. As such, many industries and laboratories are seeking safer alternatives.
    
    Isomers: 1,4-Dioxane (p-Dioxane) - most common isomer; 1,3-Dioxane (m-Dioxane); 1,2-Dioxane (o-Dioxane).
