ABOUT: |
    Platinum diselenide (PtSe<sub>2</sub>) is a member of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family, similar to materials like MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>. It forms layered structures that can be exfoliated into ultrathin layers or even monolayers. Unique among the TMDs, PtSe<sub>2</sub> has garnered attention due to its interesting electronic and optical properties. For instance, it exhibits both semiconducting and metallic behaviors depending on its layer thickness. Monolayer PtSe<sub>2</sub> possesses a direct bandgap, which is promising for applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, its high thermal stability and potential for integrating with other electronic materials make it a promising candidate for future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Ongoing research seeks to further explore its intrinsic properties and potential applications in devices such as transistors, photodetectors, and sensors.
