  - SiO<sub>x</sub>

ABOUT: |
    Nonstoichiometric silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>) holds a significant place in diverse technological and scientific domains. Its composition isn't fixed, indicated by the 'x' in the formula, which underscores the variability in oxygen content. This inherent flexibility enables a customization of properties, yielding materials with tailored electrical, optical, and physical characteristics. In contexts spanning from optics to microelectronics, SiO<sub>x</sub> is valued for its adaptable refractive indices and electrical behaviors, making it a versatile material in the manufacturing of sensors, waveguides, and various other devices. The ability to precisely control its nonstoichiometric composition via advanced fabrication and treatment methods underpins its widespread applicability. From semiconductor technologies to advanced coatings and an array of other applications, SiO<sub>x</sub> continues to be instrumental due to its customizable and diverse property profile.
