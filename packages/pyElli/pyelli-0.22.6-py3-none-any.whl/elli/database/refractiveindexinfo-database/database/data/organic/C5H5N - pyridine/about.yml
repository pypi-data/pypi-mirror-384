ABOUT: |
    Pyridine (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N) is an organic compound featuring a heterocyclic ring structure containing one nitrogen atom. It appears as a colorless to pale yellow liquid with a distinctive, pungent odor often compared to fish. Pyridine is widely utilized as a solvent and reagent in organic synthesis, particularly in the manufacture of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and vitamins. Additionally, its electrical conductivity and coordination properties make it valuable in electrochemistry and as a precursor in the synthesis of many agrochemicals and dyes. In terms of optics, pyridine's specific refractive index properties may be exploited in various applications. Due to its toxicity and unpleasant odor, careful handling and adequate ventilation are essential when working with pyridine.
