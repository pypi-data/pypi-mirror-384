ABOUT: |
    Potassium tantalate (KTaO<sub>3</sub>) is a perovskite-structured crystal that has garnered interest in the field of optics and electronics. With its good mechanical and optical properties, KTaO<sub>3</sub> serves as a substrate for epitaxial growth of various complex oxides. Additionally, it is used in a variety of applications, including electro-optic modulators, pyroelectric detectors, and nonlinear optics. The material is transparent in the visible and infrared regions, making it valuable for a range of light-based technologies. It is generally non-toxic but should be handled with the usual precautions for chemicals and materials.
