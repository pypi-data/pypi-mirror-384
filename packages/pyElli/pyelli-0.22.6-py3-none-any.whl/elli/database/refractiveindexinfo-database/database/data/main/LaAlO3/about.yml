ABOUT: |
    Lanthanum aluminate, LaAlO3 (LAO), has been regarded as an ideal substrate material for epitaxial growth of 1-2-3 type superconducting thin films due to a close lattice match within 1 percent as well as its low dielectric constant and loss tangent compared to other common substrate materials.
