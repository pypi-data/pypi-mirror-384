ABOUT: |
    Aluminium (Al) is a lightweight and highly reflective metal that sees extensive use in a variety of optical applications. Known for its excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, aluminium is often utilized as a mirror coating in optical systems such as telescopes and microscopes, particularly for operations within the ultraviolet and visible spectral ranges. While it offers high reflectivity, it is also cost-effective, making it a popular choice across both consumer and industrial sectors. However, aluminium surfaces are generally more prone to oxidation than other reflective metals like gold or silver. To counteract this, aluminium coatings are frequently protected by a thin layer of dielectric material. In photonics, aluminium nanostructures are also being investigated for their plasmonic properties. It's worth noting that the optical properties of aluminium, such as its refractive index, can differ based on its physical stateâ€”whether in bulk, thin film, or nanoparticle form. Overall, aluminium remains a versatile and widely used material in the field of optics, valued for its blend of performance and affordability.
