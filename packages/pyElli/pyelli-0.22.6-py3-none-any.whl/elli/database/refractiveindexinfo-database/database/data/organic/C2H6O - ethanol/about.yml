ABOUT: |
    Ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), often simply referred to as alcohol, is a clear, colorless liquid with a characteristic pleasant odor. It is best known as the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages but also has significant industrial and medicinal applications. As a solvent, it is widely used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In the medical field, it serves as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and as an antidote in methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethanol is also used as a renewable fuel and fuel additive, typically referred to as bioethanol, which is produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeast.
