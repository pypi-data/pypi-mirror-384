ABOUT: |
    Scandium sesquioxide (Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a white solid compound that is classified as a rare earth oxide. It exhibits a high melting point and stability under various conditions. Scandium sesquioxide is transparent to infrared light, making it useful for certain optical applications. In the world of research, Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is used as a starting material for the synthesis of scandium-containing compounds and is often employed as a dopant in various materials to improve their luminescent properties. Additionally, due to its relatively high dielectric constant and good thermal conductivity, scandium sesquioxide has been investigated for potential applications in electronics. Overall, while its use is niche, it remains an important compound in both the optical and electronic materials domains.
