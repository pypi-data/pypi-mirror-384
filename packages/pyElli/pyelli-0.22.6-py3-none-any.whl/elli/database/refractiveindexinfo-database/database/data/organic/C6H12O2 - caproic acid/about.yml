ABOUT: |
    Caproic acid is a saturated medium-chain fatty acid with a six-carbon backbone. It is a colorless, oily liquid with an odor reminiscent of goats, from which its name is derived (Latin "capra" meaning goat). Naturally found in various animal fats and oils, caproic acid is used in the manufacturing of esters for artificial flavors and perfumes. It also serves as a chemical intermediate in the production of hexyl derivatives.
