ABOUT: |
    Mercury gallium sulfide (HgGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) is a ternary compound notable for its non-linear optical properties. It is primarily used in optical applications, such as frequency conversion and phase matching in laser systems. The compound's non-linear optical coefficients make it suitable for second harmonic generation (SHG) and other non-linear processes. However, the presence of mercury in the compound necessitates careful handling due to toxicity risks. Research into this material often focuses on optimizing its non-linear characteristics and improving its thermal and mechanical stability for optical applications.
