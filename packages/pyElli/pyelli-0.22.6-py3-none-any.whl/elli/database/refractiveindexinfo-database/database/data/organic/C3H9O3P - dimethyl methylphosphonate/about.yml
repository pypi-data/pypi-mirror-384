ABOUT: |
    Dimethyl methylphosphonate (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>3</sub>P) is an organic compound that is commonly used as a flame retardant and as a plasticizer. It is a clear, colorless liquid at room temperature and is soluble in many organic solvents. This compound is characterized by the presence of phosphorus in its molecular structure. In addition to its industrial uses, dimethyl methylphosphonate is often employed as a simulant in studies related to the detection and decontamination of nerve agent threats due to its structural similarities with certain nerve agents.
