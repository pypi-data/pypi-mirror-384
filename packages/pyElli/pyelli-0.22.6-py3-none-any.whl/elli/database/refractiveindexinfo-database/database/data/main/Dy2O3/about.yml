ABOUT: |
    Dysprosium sesquioxide (Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a rare-earth oxide that can exist in several crystalline phases. Its optical properties, such as a high refractive index and low absorption coefficients in the infrared region, make it interesting for specialized optical applications. It is also used as a raw material for producing dysprosium metal and various dysprosium compounds. Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can be incorporated into glass, ceramics, and crystal hosts to modify their optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. While not as commonly encountered as other rare-earth oxides in optical applications, its unique characteristics make it a material of interest for future developments in both academia and industry.
