ABOUT: |
    Propyl acetate (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a colorless, flammable liquid with a pleasant, fruity odor similar to pears. It is an ester formed from the reaction of propanol and acetic acid. Propyl acetate exists in two isomeric forms: n-propyl acetate and isopropyl acetate. Both isomers are used as solvents in coatings, inks, adhesives, and fragrances due to their effective solvency and fast evaporation rates.
    
    n-Propyl acetate has the structure CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>, where the acetate group is attached to a primary carbon atom.
    
    Chemical formula:
    CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>
    
    Isopropyl acetate has the structure CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, where the acetate group is attached to a secondary carbon atom.
    
    Chemical formula:
    CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
