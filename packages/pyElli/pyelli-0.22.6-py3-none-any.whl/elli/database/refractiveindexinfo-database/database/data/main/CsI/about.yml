ABOUT: |
    Caesium iodide (CsI) is an inorganic compound known for its wide range of applications, from scintillation counters in high-energy physics to the field of medical imaging. This compound forms colorless, water-soluble crystals and has high gamma-ray stopping power, making it particularly useful as a scintillator material. It is also notable for its transparency in the wide spectral range from ultraviolet to long-wavelength infrared, which makes it valuable in infrared optics. In addition, CsI is often used in mass spectrometry as a matrix to help ionize samples. Like other caesium compounds, CsI should be handled with care due to its reactivity and potential health risks associated with iodine and caesium, such as thyroid gland issues and cellular ion channel disruptions. As a result, strict safety protocols are essential for its handling and storage. Overall, CsI is a highly versatile material with a plethora of applications in both scientific research and industrial processes.
