ABOUT: |
    Sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly known as table salt, is a white crystalline compound. In its purified form, it is transparent and can be shaped into clear optical windows. With its wide transparency range that extends from the ultraviolet through to the infrared spectrum, NaCl finds significant utility in the optics field. It's particularly well-suited for infrared spectroscopy. However, being hygroscopic, it readily absorbs moisture from the air, which can degrade its optical performance. Thus, careful handling and storage are essential when using it for optical applications.
