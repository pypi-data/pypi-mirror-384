ABOUT: |
    Polylactic acid (PLA, (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>) is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. It has captured significant attention due to its compostability under industrial conditions, positioning it as an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based plastics. PLA is utilized in a multitude of applications ranging from food packaging to biomedicine, such as drug delivery systems and surgical implants. In the realm of optics, PLA is typically transparent, with a refractive index that can be influenced by factors like crystallinity and processing methods. Though its mechanical strength is comparable to that of polystyrene, PLA has a lower melting temperature, which can limit its use in certain high-temperature applications. Nevertheless, due to its biocompatibility and environmentally friendly nature, polylactic acid continues to be a material of interest for both research and commercial purposes.
