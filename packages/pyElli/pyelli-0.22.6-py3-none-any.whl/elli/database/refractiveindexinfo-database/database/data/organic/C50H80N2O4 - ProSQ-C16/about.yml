ABOUT: |
    ProSQ-C16 is an organic squaraine dye known for its strong absorption and emission in the near-infrared region. With a molecular formula of C<sub>50</sub>H<sub>80</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, it features a squaraine core linked to long alkyl chains containing 16 carbon atoms each. These extended chains enhance the dye's solubility and film-forming properties, making it suitable for various optoelectronic applications. ProSQ-C16 exists in two enantiomerically pure forms, (S,S)-ProSQ-C16 and (R,R)-ProSQ-C16, as well as in a racemic mixture called rac-ProSQ-C16. The enantiomerically pure forms, (S,S) and (R,R), share the same complex refractive index. However, the racemic mixture exhibits different optical properties and a different complex refractive index due to the presence of both enantiomers. This dye is of significant interest for its chiroptical properties, such as circular dichroism and optical activity, making it valuable in studies of molecular chirality and supramolecular chemistry.
