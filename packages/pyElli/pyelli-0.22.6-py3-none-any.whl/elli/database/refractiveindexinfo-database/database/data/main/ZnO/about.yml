ABOUT: |
    Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a wide bandgap of approximately 3.37 eV. This unique property makes it a material of significant interest for various optoelectronic applications, including solar cells, sensors, and LEDs. ZnO also exhibits piezoelectric properties, which are exploited in the design of sensors and actuators. It naturally forms in a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure, displaying strong luminescence even at room temperature. Additionally, ZnO is a transparent conductive oxide, meaning it conducts electricity while remaining transparent to visible light, making it useful in transparent electronics and touchscreens. Due to its antibacterial and UV-blocking properties, ZnO is also commonly used as an ingredient in cosmetics and sunscreens.
