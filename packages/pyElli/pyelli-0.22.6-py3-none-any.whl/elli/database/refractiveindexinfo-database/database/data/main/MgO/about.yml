ABOUT: |
    Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a white solid that exhibits refractory and insulating properties. It's commonly used in the ceramics industry and for producing crucibles. In thin film form, MgO serves as an excellent substrate for the growth of high-quality epitaxial films and is transparent in the ultraviolet to infrared regions, making it suitable for various optical applications.
