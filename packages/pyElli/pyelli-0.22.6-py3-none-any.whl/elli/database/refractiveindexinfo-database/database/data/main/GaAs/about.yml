ABOUT: |
    Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is a compound semiconductor material that holds a prominent position in the world of optoelectronics and high-frequency electronics. With a direct bandgap of approximately 1.43 eV, GaAs is highly efficient for radiation recombination, making it ideal for a range of applications such as solar cells, lasers, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). It offers superior electron mobility compared to silicon, which allows for faster electronic devices and is widely used in applications requiring high-frequency operation like in microwave and millimeter-wave technologies. GaAs is commonly grown using methods such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). While it's more costly to produce than silicon, the material's superior electronic and optoelectronic properties often justify the additional expense in specialized applications.
