ABOUT: |
    Niobium-doped strontium titanate (Nb:SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) is a transparent, electrically conductive oxide crystal frequently employed as a substrate or electrode material for advanced electronic and photonic applications. Doping strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) with niobium significantly enhances its electrical conductivity without compromising transparency, making Nb:SrTiOâ‚ƒ an excellent choice for oxide electronics, superconducting thin films, transparent electrodes, and heterostructure interfaces. Due to its favorable lattice match with various perovskite oxides and robust thermal and chemical stability, Nb:SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrates are widely utilized in thin-film epitaxy, spintronic devices, and fundamental research on functional oxide materials.
