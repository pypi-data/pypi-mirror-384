ABOUT: |
    Dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), also known as methylene chloride, is a volatile, colorless liquid with a characteristic sweet odor. It is commonly used as a solvent in paint strippers, aerosol formulations, and various chemical extraction processes, including the decaffeination of coffee. Due to its relatively high volatility, care must be taken when handling dichloromethane to avoid excessive inhalation, as prolonged exposure can pose health risks. 
    
    In the realm of optics and spectroscopy, dichloromethaneâ€™s refractive properties are of interest for studying solvent effects and reaction kinetics. Its ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds, combined with its transparent nature in certain wavelengths, makes it valuable in laboratory-based optical and spectroscopic measurements.
