ABOUT: |
    Trichlorobenzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>) is a chlorinated derivative of benzene that exists in three isomeric forms: 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. These colorless liquids are relatively insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. Trichlorobenzenes are utilized for various purposes, including as a solvent for a range of materials, an intermediate in chemical synthesis, and a dielectric fluid in transformers. Due to their persistent nature and potential environmental concerns, their use has become more regulated in many jurisdictions. When investigating trichlorobenzene's optical properties, it's important to note which isomer is under consideration as properties can vary. Handling should be performed with caution, ensuring adequate ventilation and avoiding prolonged exposure.
    
    Isomers: 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene; 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene; 1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene.
