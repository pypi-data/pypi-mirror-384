ABOUT: |
    Ethyl acetate (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, EtOAc, EA) is a colorless, volatile liquid with a sweet, fruity odor reminiscent of pear drops. As a medium-polarity solvent, it finds use in a variety of industries, especially in the manufacture of inks, adhesives, and coatings. It's frequently employed as a solvent for extractions in laboratory procedures and in the production of varnishes and nail polish removers. Additionally, due to its pleasant smell, ethyl acetate is occasionally used in the formulation of perfumes and as a flavoring agent in food products.
