ABOUT: |
    Butanol (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O) refers to a group of four isomeric alcohol compounds with a four-carbon structure. The isomers include n-butanol (or 1-butanol), isobutanol (or 2-methyl-1-propanol), sec-butanol (or 2-butanol), and tert-butanol (or 2-methyl-2-propanol). Of these, n-butanol is the most commonly referred to when discussing "butanol."
    
    Butanol is a colorless liquid at room temperature with a characteristic alcoholic odor. It is moderately soluble in water but is very soluble in most organic solvents. It's utilized in a wide variety of applications, including as a solvent in the manufacturing of resins, plasticizers, and other chemicals. It's also employed in the formulation of paints, coatings, varnishes, and inks. In addition, butanol is considered a potential biofuel, as it can be produced from biomass sources and has properties comparable to gasoline.
    
    Chemical formula (n-Butanol):
    CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH or C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>OH
    
    
    Chemical formula (sec-Butanol):
    CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>
    
    Chemical formula (Isobutanol):
    (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>OH
    
    Chemical formula (tert-Butanol):
    (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COH
