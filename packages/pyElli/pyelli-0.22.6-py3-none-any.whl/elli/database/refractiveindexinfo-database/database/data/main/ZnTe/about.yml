ABOUT: |
    Zinc telluride (ZnTe) is a binary II-VI semiconductor compound with a direct bandgap that makes it attractive for several optoelectronic applications. It has a cubic crystal structure and is known for its photoluminescent properties. ZnTe is particularly important in the development of semiconductor devices for terahertz frequencies. It is also utilized as a buffer layer in some solar cell configurations, especially in tandem with cadmium telluride (CdTe). Moreover, its ability to form alloyed compounds with other II-VI semiconductors, like CdTe, allows for the tuning of optical properties for specific applications. The compound is also studied for potential use in blue and green light-emitting diodes and laser diodes.
