ABOUT: |
    Boron phosphide (BP) is a compound of boron and phosphorus that possesses a range of intriguing properties suitable for both electronic and optoelectronic applications. It commonly crystallizes in a zinc blende structure and exhibits a direct bandgap of approximately 2.1 eV, which renders it useful in applications requiring high thermal stability and wide-bandgap properties. The material is known for its high hardness, chemical resistance, and high thermal conductivity, making it ideal for use in harsh environments. BP is often used as a semiconducting material in devices such as photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. Additionally, it is employed as a specialized abrasive and in cutting applications due to its hardness. Various synthesis methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), are used to produce high-quality BP crystals. Its combination of electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties makes boron phosphide a material of interest for specialized applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and other high-performance technologies.
