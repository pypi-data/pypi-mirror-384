ABOUT: |
    Lithium triborate (LiB<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, commonly abbreviated as LBO) is a nonlinear optical crystal that is highly useful for frequency conversion processes, including second and third harmonic generation, sum and difference frequency generation, and optical parametric oscillation. LBO crystals offer wide transparency ranges, broad phase-matching capabilities, and high damage thresholds, making them ideal for high-power laser applications. It is also appreciated for its good mechanical and thermal stability. Overall, LBO is a versatile and widely-used material in various optical and laser-based technologies.
