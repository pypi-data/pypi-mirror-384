ABOUT: |
    Niobium pentoxide (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is a pale yellow compound that is commonly used in the manufacture of certain optical glasses, where it imparts a high refractive index. In addition to its use in specialty glasses, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has garnered attention in the photonics industry due to its nonlinear optical properties, making it suitable for devices like waveguides and modulators. The material also finds application in the field of electronics as a dielectric layer in capacitors and has potential in the development of electrochromic devices. Its high dielectric constant further positions it as a candidate for thin film capacitors and transistors.
