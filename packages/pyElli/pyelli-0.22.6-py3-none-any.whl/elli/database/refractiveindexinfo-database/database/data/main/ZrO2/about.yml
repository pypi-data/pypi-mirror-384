ABOUT: |
    Zirconium dioxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), often known as zirconia, is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium. Its most naturally occurring form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the mineral baddeleyite. Zirconia is synthesized in various colors for use as a gemstone or in jewelry â€“ cubic zirconia. The material's high melting point, chemical resistance, and low thermal conductivity make it a valuable component in various refractory applications. Additionally, its notable toughness and biocompatibility have made it a popular choice for dental ceramics and other biomedical applications, like hip implants. In optical applications, stabilized zirconia is used as a solid-state electrolyte in oxygen sensors and fuel cells due to its high oxygen ion conductivity.
