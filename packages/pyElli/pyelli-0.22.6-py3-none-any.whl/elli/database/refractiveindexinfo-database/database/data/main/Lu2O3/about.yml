ABOUT: |
    Lutetium sesquioxide (Lu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is a white, crystalline compound of lutetium. This material is characterized by its high melting point and stability. In the realm of optics, Lu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is known for its excellent scintillation properties, making it suitable for radiation detection applications. It is often used as a scintillating crystal in detectors, and its high atomic number aids in the efficient detection of gamma rays. Moreover, its transparency in the infrared region can be harnessed in specialized optical applications.
