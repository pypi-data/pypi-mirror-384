ABOUT: |
    Potassium fluoride (KF) is a crystalline material with particular usefulness in optical applications. It exhibits good transmission properties in the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared spectral regions. Unlike potassium chloride or bromide, it offers better moisture resistance, making it more versatile for use in environmental conditions that include some humidity. Frequently, KF is employed in windows and lenses for specialized optical systems, particularly those operating in the ultraviolet range. However, users should still exercise caution while handling it, as potassium fluoride can be corrosive. Overall, its combination of optical and chemical properties makes it a valuable material in various optical applications.
