ABOUT: |
    Ytterbium trifluoride (YbF<sub>3</sub>) is a chemical compound composed of ytterbium and fluorine. As with many lanthanide fluorides, YbF<sub>3</sub> possesses unique optical properties, making it a substance of interest in the fields of optics and photonics. When used as a dopant in certain glass systems, it can imbue the host material with specific luminescent properties advantageous for laser applications. Furthermore, its high thermal stability, coupled with its characteristic low phonon energy, positions YbF<sub>3</sub> as a potential material for infrared non-linear optical applications. Ytterbium trifluoride is also used in metal-organic frameworks and other chemical synthesis as a fluoride source or for its ytterbium content. In its solid form, YbF<sub>3</sub> typically appears as a white or off-white crystalline powder.
