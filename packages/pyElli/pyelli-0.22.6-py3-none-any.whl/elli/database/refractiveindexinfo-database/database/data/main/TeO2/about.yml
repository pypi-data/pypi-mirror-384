ABOUT: |
    Tellurium dioxide (TeO<sub>2</sub>) is a solid, white crystalline compound and is the most commonly encountered oxide of tellurium. It is an amphoteric oxide, meaning it can act both as an acid or a base depending on the reaction. Its unique properties make it useful for a range of applications. One of the most prominent applications of TeO<sub>2</sub> is in the production of glass. Due to its high refractive index and unique dispersive properties, it's used to make acousto-optic devices, which can be used to diffract and modulate light using sound waves. TeO<sub>2</sub> is also a significant precursor in the synthesis of other tellurium compounds. In the field of nonlinear optics, tellurium dioxide crystals have been employed for frequency doubling and other wavelength conversion processes. Its transparent nature in the visible and near-infrared region makes it a favorable material for these optical applications.
