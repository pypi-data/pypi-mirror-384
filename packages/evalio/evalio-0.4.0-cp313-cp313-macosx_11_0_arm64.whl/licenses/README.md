Due to the packaging of the C++ pipelines, evalio includes compiled binaries of various dependencies. We include their licenses here for reference. Additionally, none of the source code of non-MIT-licensed dependencies was modified, and only minor patches were made to the build scripts for the pipelines.

Dependency licenses are prefixed with "dep_" and pipelines with "pipe_". Some of these are MIT licensed and do not require a redistribution of the license, but we do anyways for completeness.

It should be noted that none of the dependencies have a viral (ie GPL) license.
