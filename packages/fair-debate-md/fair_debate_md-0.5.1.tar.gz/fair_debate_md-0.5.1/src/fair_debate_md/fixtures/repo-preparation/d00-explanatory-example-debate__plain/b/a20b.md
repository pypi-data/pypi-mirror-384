## Further Remarks

### Unusually Cooperative Style of this Debate

As you probably noticed, this document repurposes the unfolding-feature to avoid a deterrent "wall of text" which most people would not read. As a consequence, in this "debate" answers are cooperative: They continue the narration of the statements to which they refer. In a real debate answers will instead often challenge the statement, or ask questions.

### Development Status of Fair Debate and Evolution of this Document

As pointed out on the landing page Fair Debate (i.e. the website on which are viewing this) is currently a highly experimental early prototype. It aims to test features and gather feedback for further development. With incoming feedback and ongoing development naturally, this "example debate" will have to change. Strictly speaking, every such change violates the integrity of the debates' content. This is not a problem since the motivation for those changes is obvious but it should not go unmentioned. For future versions, it is planned to make the evolution of the content repos transparent to the user in a suitable way. Currently, this content just lives in the source code repo of the backend ðŸ¤·.
