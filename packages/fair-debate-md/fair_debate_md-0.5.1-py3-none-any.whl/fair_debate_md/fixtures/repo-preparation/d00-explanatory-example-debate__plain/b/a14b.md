This is an answer to statement `a14` (first entry of the numbered list of features). This answer itself is also a *contribution*. Because it refers to statement `a14` its contribution key is `a14b`. This contribution consequently also consists of referenceable and answerable statements (keys: `a14b1`, `a14b2` etc).

Note that:

- Each answer-contribution is displayed directly below the statement to which it refers. **Thus, "persistent in-context-answers" means: Every single statement is tied to its context, both by its key and by its display location.** To improve oversight and clearness different answer-levels can be hidden or unhidden by users.
- Each answer contribution is distinguished by color and indentation from the text of the surrounding contribution.
- In the current version only two parties of a debate are supported: Party (a) on the "Pro"-side (w.r.t. the initial contribution) and Party (b) on the "Contra"-side (w.r.t. the initial contribution). Each party is associated with a single user account.
- Contributions can be styled using Markdown syntax.
