### Motivation

As all kinds of infrastructure a discussion platform is operated and controlled by humans. In truly controversial discussions about a polarizing topic there might be the risk that the operator of the discussion platform interferes in the content, e.g. by deletion or manipulation. Another risk is that, e.g. after an argument turned out to be wrong, the platform is falsely accused of manipulation.

### Realization

The approach of *Fair Debate* counters both risks by outsourcing the storage of the content to public git hosting services such as GitHub: Each contribution is stored in a plain text file and committed to a repo. When displaying the current state of the debate the platform does not load the content from a local database. This would be intransparent and allow for undetectable manipulation. Instead the displayed contents are loaded from the public git repos of the participants\*. Those repos contain the whole change-history and their consistency is ensured by cryptographic hashes. Thus, any manipulation but also any false accusation of manipulation is easily detectable.
