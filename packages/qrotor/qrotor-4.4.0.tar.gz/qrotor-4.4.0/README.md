QRotor is a Python package used to study molecular rotations
based on the one-dimensional hindered-rotor model,
such as those of methyl and amine groups.
It can calculate their quantum energy levels and wavefunctions,
along with excitations and tunnel splittings.

QRotor systematically produces Quantum ESPRESSO SCF calculations to obtain
the rotational Potential Energy Surface (PES) of custom molecular structures.
This potential is used to solve the quantum hamiltonian of the hindered rotor model:

$$
H = -B \frac{d^2}{d\varphi^2} + V(\varphi)
$$

where $B$ is the *kinetic rotational energy* constant,

$$
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2\sum_{i}m_{i}r_{i}^{2}}
$$

# Usage


## Solving quantum eigenvalues for one-dimensional rotor systems


Let's start with a basic calculation of the eigenvalues for a zero potential, corresponding to a free rotor. 
Note that the default energy unit is meV unless stated otherwise.

```python
import qrotor as qr
system = qr.System()
system.gridsize = 200000  # Size of the potential grid
system.B = 1              # Rotational inertia
system.potential_name = 'zero'
system.solve()
print(system.eigenvalues)
# [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 4.0, 9.0, 9.0, ...]  # approx values
```

The accuracy of the calculation increases with bigger gridsizes,
but note that the runtime increases exponentially.

Predefined synthetic potentials can be used,
see all available options in the [qrotor.potential](https://pablogila.github.io/qrotor/qrotor/potential.html) documentation.
For example, we can solve the system for a hindered methyl group,
in a [cosine potential](https://pablogila.github.io/qrotor/qrotor/potential.html#cosine) of amplitude 30 meV:

```python
import qrotor as qr
system = qr.System()
system.gridsize = 200000
system.B = qr.B_CH3  # Rotational inertia of a methyl group
system.potential_name = 'cosine'
system.potential_constants = [0, 30, 3, 0]  # Offset, max, freq, phase (for cosine potential)
system.solve()
# Plot potential and eigenvalues
qr.plot.energies(system)
# Plot the first wavefunctions
qr.plot.wavefunction(system, levels=[0,1,2], square=True)
```


## Rotational PES from custom structures


QRotor can be used to calculate the rotational Potential Energy Surface (PES) from DFT calculations.
Currently only Quantum ESPRESSO is supported,
although other DFT codes can be easily implemented through [ATON](https://pablogila.github.io/aton).

First, run a Quantum ESPRESSO SCF calculation for a methyl rotation every 10 degrees:

```python
import qrotor as qr
from aton import api
# Approx crystal positions of the atoms to rotate
atoms = [
    '1.101   1.204   1.307'
    '2.102   2.205   2.308'
    '3.103   3.206   3.309'
]
# Create the input SCF files, saving the filenames to a list
scf_files = qr.rotate.structure_qe('molecule.in', positions=atoms, angle=10, repeat=True)
# Run the Quantum ESPRESSO calculations
api.slurm.sbatch(files=scf_files)
```

You can compile a `potential.csv` file with the calculated potential as a function of the angle,
and load it into a new [system](https://pablogila.github.io/qrotor/qrotor/system.html):

```python
system = qr.potential.from_qe()
# Check the potential
qr.plot.potential(system)
# Solve the system, interpolating to a bigger gridsize
system.B = qr.B_CH3
system.solve(200000)
qr.plot.energies(system)
```


## Other quantum observables


The Zero-Point Energies (ZPEs), quantum tunnel splittings, excitations and energy level degeneracy
below the potential maximum are also calculated upon solving the [system](https://pablogila.github.io/qrotor/qrotor/system.html):

```python
system.solve()
print(system.eigenvalues[0])
print(system.splittings)
print(system.excitations)
print(system.deg)
```

An integer `System.deg` degeneracy (e.g. 3 for methyls)
indicates that the energy levels have been properly estimated.
However, if the degeneracy is a float instead,
you might want to check the splittings and excitations manually from the system eigenvalues.

To export the energies and the tunnel splittings of several calculations to a CSV file:

```python
calculations = [system1, system2, system3]
qr.systems.save_energies(calculations)
qr.systems.save_splittings(calculations)
```

Excitations are calculated using the mean for each energy level
with respect to the ground state.
Tunnel splittings for each level are calculated as the difference between A and E,
considering the mean of the eigenvalues for each sublevel.

For major changes, please get in touch first to discuss the details.  


## Code style


Please try to follow some general guidelines:  
- Use a code style consistent with the rest of the project.  
- Include docstrings to document new additions.  
- Include automated tests for new features or modifications, see [automated testing](#automated-testing).  
- Arrange function arguments by order of relevance.  


## Automated testing


If you are modifying the source code, you should run the automated tests of the [`tests/`](https://github.com/pablogila/qrotor/tree/main/tests) folder to check that everything works as intended.
To do so, first install PyTest in your environment,
```bash
pip install pytest
```

And then run PyTest inside the main directory,
```bash
pytest -vv
```


## Compiling the documentation

The documentation can be compiled automatically to `docs/qrotor.html` with [Pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) and [ATON](https://pablogila.github.io/aton), by running:
```shell
python3 makedocs.py
```

This runs Pdoc, updating links and pictures, and using the custom theme CSS template from the `css/` folder.
