*** WARNING:   The implicit Newmark-beta integrator. While sub-stepping, the simulation requested a step size of 1.06581e-10 ms less than the mininum allowed value (1e-06 ms). Repeated instances of this message suggest a problem with the numerical integration during simulation
*** Note:   Averaged number of iterations per full time step in fixed-step integrator: 2.81
*** Note:   - Percentage of time steps that required sub-stepping: 0.19%
