2.14.905 (2025-10-16)
=====================

- Fixed error when passing a BufferProtocol compatible object as a HTTP request body. (#286)

2.14.904 (2025-10-12)
=====================

- Fixed a small performance issue with a non-multiplexed connection (in both sync and async) under concurrent loads.

2.14.903 (2025-10-11)
=====================

- Fixed an async performance issue under high task concurrency pressure. The best-effort multiplexing strategy
  has been significantly improved. Expect better performance in environments with many concurrent tasks.

2.14.902 (2025-10-06)
=====================

- Fixed rare edge case where a server would close the socket after executing a request, thus misleading our implementation to retry. (#280)
- Changed ``qh3`` dependency definition constraint to include the RISCV64 platform by default.
- Added preemptive detection of closed socket when in TCP mode for most OSes. This avoid to send a request in a pending close socket. (#280) (#281)

2.14.901 (2025-10-02)
=====================

- Fixed support for ``PySocks`` socks legacy proxy connector (#271).
- Removed warning yielded in ``contrib.socks`` inviting to use python-socks instead of PySocks.

2.14.900 (2025-09-21)
=====================

- Fixed the determinism for the presence of this package. ``urllib3-future`` automatically takes precedence over
  upstream ``urllib3`` no matter the order of installation. This also fix the issue where a package manager would
  concurrently and blindly install both. Installing your dependencies like ``URLLIB3_NO_OVERRIDE=true pip install niquests --no-binary urllib3-future``
  will not trigger the post-install procedure (ie. ``urllib3-future`` automatically takes precedence).
  This will bring higher confidence of reproducibility, especially when the project relies on a ``lock`` file.

2.13.909 (2025-09-14)
=====================

- Fixed handling async iterable as body for upload. The logic for chunking the body into socket "blocksize" had a
  flaw.

2.13.908 (2025-09-10)
=====================

- Fixed an edge case where a server would interrupt a SSE without error by closing the connection instead of using the FIN bit
  on the last data chunk.

2.13.907 (2025-09-09)
=====================

- Fixed unhandled error in HTTP/3 upgrade (TCP+TLS to QUIC) procedure that mainly affect Windows users.
  If your network silently filter QUIC packets or UDP is unreliable outside of your local network the
  upgrade procedure could raise an exception instead of silently giving up on QUIC.
- Fixed the accidental leaking of ``MustRedialException`` error in the consumption of the response (including WS or SEE).

2.13.906 (2025-08-27)
=====================

- Fixed charset transparency setter to not enforce ``charset=utf-8`` in Content-Type anymore due to incompatibilities found
  in widely requested servers that still don't parse HTTP headers appropriately. We saw a 3rd party report that
  a server rejected a request because it expected Content-Type to be exactly "X" and not "X; charset=utf-8".

2.13.905 (2025-08-23)
=====================

- Fixed rare edge cases where upgrading or forcing HTTP/3 over QUIC with zero SSL configuration would lead
  to an error validating the chain of certificate. This would also trigger needlessly a ``load_default_certs``
  when not needed.

2.13.904 (2025-08-20)
=====================

- Improved performance when creating TLS connection. We removed a redundant ssl_ctx creation due to our
  caching / reusability for ssl.SSLContext.
- Fixed forcing disabling SSL renegotiation when explicitly setting ``@SECLEVEL=0`` in the cipher suite.
- Fixed ssl_ctx caching invalidation when ca_certs and/or ca_cert_dir file/directory changed.

2.13.903 (2025-08-11)
=====================

- Bumped lower bound of qh3. The ``crlDistributionPoints`` getter is now officially implemented in qh3 >= 1.5.4.

2.13.902 (2025-08-10)
=====================

- Fixed long standing missing ``ciphers`` kwargs that can be propagated without a
  custom ``ssl.SSLContext`` via ``(Async)PoolManager`` and others.
- Fixed a bug the connection was not properly closed (underlying fd) when fingerprint matching failed in async.
- Fixed missing ``crlDistributionPoints`` not extracted from cert in ``ConnectionInfo`` (QUIC layer only).

2.13.901 (2025-08-02)
=====================

- Fixed a memory leakage when downloading large content and specifying a chunk size
  that is lower than your regular incoming chunk size. (https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/270)

2.13.900 (2025-06-22)
=====================

- Fixed passing ``ca_cert_data`` as ``bytes`` instead of ``str``.
- Backported Security fix CVE-2025-50181 (5.3 Medium, GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v) from upstream urllib3 v2.5.0
- Fixed backward incompatible change on the ssl configuration when urllib3-future is invoked by other than Niquests.
  The default cipher list will fallback to system's default when Niquests is not the invoker. Also stop setting
  ``OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION`` in ssl_options when it's not Niquests.
- Fixed a rare bug causing the connection to improperly upgrade to QUIC when no ssl ca are given.
- Updated the low bound version requirement for ``qh3`` to v1.5.3 due to some significant improvement toward
  unifying PKI validation behaviors with Python default expectation (w/ OpenSSL).
- Changed default behavior when passing a SSLContext with no loaded CA in store. Previously we did not called
  ``load_default_certs``. We now check if the store is empty, then we load the default certs.

2.12.922 (2025-05-19)
=====================

- Fixed a minor performance regression when reopening or upgrading a HTTPS connection.

2.12.921 (2025-05-17)
=====================

- Extended in-memory mTLS loading support to every major platforms.
- Added support for built-in zstandard starting from Python 3.14 onward.
- Improved test suite execution speed using pytest-xdist.
- Fixed a rare edge case where the CAStore would be empty after upgrade to a HTTP/3 connection when no CA bundle are given before.
  This error occurred due to load_default_certs not being applied for the QUIC connection.

2.12.920 (2025-05-04)
=====================

- Removed the persisting session ticket after first QUIC handshake. In a effort to be stricter with security and align
  with our TLS 1.2 and 1.3 ``OP_NO_TICKET`` parameter.
- Improved performance in our event unpacking logic inside state machine protocols. (micro-scale improvements)
- Improved our RDATA (DNS) parsing for HTTPS records toward our ECH (Encrypted Client Hello) support coming soon.
- Fixed a rare HTTP/2 compatibility issue with servers that don't acknowledge our settings (missing ACK frame).

2.12.919 (2025-04-28)
=====================

- Fixed http3 has_expired logic to take into account "client side abort without close event". https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/240
- Improved performances in our state machine protocols.
- Fixed PoolManager allocation when maxsize is reached (async). https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/247
- Fixed PoolManager response mapping per pool memory leak.

2.12.918 (2025-04-19)
=====================

- Fixed http3 QUIC idle timeout did not force the connection to be dropped by the pool.

2.12.917 (2025-04-10)
=====================

- Improve keepalive handling for connections. We now listen for an incoming pong frame after emitting a ping frame.
  Moreover we ensure better strictness around set ``keepalive_delay`` and consider every connection dropped after set delay.

2.12.916 (2025-04-09)
=====================

- Set a bigger initial window size for HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 streams. This improves data streaming performances.

2.12.915 (2025-04-02)
=====================

- Fixed a performance issue when streaming download by chunk (size) not in phase with incoming packets size.
  See https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/236

2.12.914 (2025-03-30)
=====================

- Fixed a rare thread safety issue when the size of PoolManager is inferior to the thread count. An edge case permitted
  the creation of two ``ConnectionPool`` for the same ``PoolKey``.
- Changed the default behavior of threads management to not raise an exception if the thread count is greater than
  the pool size. Making it that way better align with upstream, our initial decision revealed itself to cause
  confusions for some of our users. No longer will urllib3-future raise ``OverwhelmedTraffic`` in default configuration.
- Fixed an error when ``happy_eyeballs=True`` is set with more tasks or threads than the pool size.

2.12.913 (2025-03-21)
=====================

- Added useful repr for ``PoolManager``, ``ConnectionPool`` and ``TrafficPolice`` (async counterpart included).
- Fixed ``KeyError`` upon parsing X509 certificate pulled from the QUIC layer when the certificate contain an unexpected
  rfc4514 attribute. (https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/217)

2.12.912 (2025-02-07)
=====================

- Automatically grab ``qh3`` for HTTP/3 support with PyPy 3.11
- Fixed error while attempting to close a broken ``HTTPResponse`` starting from Python 3.14
  If the Content-Type is invalid or malformed, the constructor stopped initializing some members
  that are required in the closing procedure. (e.g. using ctx)
- Fixed an error when libffi does not support in-memory I/O handler. Seen so far with PyPy 3.11 beta.

2.12.911 (2025-02-05)
=====================

- Support for IDNA encode via ``qh3`` utils. This allows you to use international domain names without the
  ``idna`` package. Thus avoiding an extra dependency. This is made possible from ``qh3>=1.4``.

2.12.910 (2025-01-28)
=====================

- Fixed a rare issue where the closing of the WebSocket extension would lead to a ``RecursionError``.
  This happen when the WebSocket state machine ends in a broken state.

2.12.909 (2025-01-20)
=====================

- Fixed compatibility with upstream urllib3 when third party program invoke deprecated ``HTTPResponse.getheader`` or
  ``HTTPResponse.getheaders``. Those methods were planned to be removed in 2.1 (they still have a pending deprecation
  that mention 2.1 target in the 2.3 version). As such we immediately restore the methods. (#203)
- Implemented our copy of ``HTTPResponse.read1`` heavily simplified as we do already support ``HTTPResponse.read(-1)``.
  Also mirrored in ``AsyncHTTPResponse.read1``.
- Automatically grab ``qh3`` for X86/i686 based processors (e.g. win32).
- Fixed the aggressive exception in our native websocket implementation when a server responded positively to an upgrade
  request without the required http header. Instead of ``RuntimeError``, now raises ``ProtocolError``.

2.12.908 (2025-01-13)
=====================

- Fixed silencing the deprecation warning coming from python_socks about the "_socket" parameter.

2.12.907 (2025-01-12)
=====================

- Fixed our thread safety protection against the experimental freethreaded Python build.
  As expected, the absence of GIL challenged our implementation of ``TrafficPolice`` and
  took it to its knees. We reviewed the in-depht logic and improved it for maximum resilience
  and performance. We backported some improvements in ``AsyncTrafficPolice`` when applicable.
- Improved error message whenever the pool capacity have been exhausted.
- Fixed background discrete watcher that never reached some connections in the pool.
- Bumped allowed upper bound for ``python-socks`` to 2.6.1 (we will have to manually increase the upper bound
  each minor/patch version due to our complex integration that invoke private classes/APIs)

2.12.906 (2025-01-03)
=====================

- Improved our logic around caching a ssl_context in a concurrent environment.

2.12.905 (2024-12-29)
=====================

- Fixed error due to an internal change in python-socks 2.6
- Pinned python-socks upper bound to 2.5.3 pending further improvement into our integration.

2.12.904 (2024-12-22)
=====================

- Fixed an issue when trying to force load Websocket over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
- Ensured WebSocket via HTTP/2 with improved CI pipeline featuring haproxy as the reverse proxy.
- Fixed ``RuntimeError`` when forcing HTTP/3 by disabling both HTTP/1, and HTTP/2 and the remote is unable to negotiate HTTP/3.
  This issue occurred because of our automatic downgrade procedure introduced in our 2.10.x series. The downgrade ends in panic
  due to unavailable lower protocols. This only improve the UX by not downgrading and letting the original error out.
  See https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/189 for original user report.
- Fixed negotiated extensions for WebSocket being ignored (e.g. per-deflate message).
- Backported ``HTTPResponse.shutdown()`` and nullified it. The fix they attempt to ship only concern
  them, we are already safe (based on issue reproduction). See https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2868
- Backported ``proxy_is_tunneling`` property to ``HTTPConnection`` and ``HTTPSConnection``.
  See https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/3459
- Backported ``HTTPSConnection.is_verified`` to False when using a forwarding proxy.
  See https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/3283
- Backported pickling support to ``NewConnectionError`` and ``NameResolutionError``.
  See https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/3480

2.12.903 (2024-12-09)
=====================

- Minor improvements on our algorithm that manage multiplexed connection.
  A) We ensured that when a remote peer sent a Goaway frame, we keep the connection alive just long enough that you may
  retrieve all remaining data/response pending.
  B) HTTP/3 max stream limit was not calculated properly (and in real time) thus causing undesirable additional latency in rare cases.
  C) Implement ``is_saturated`` for ``ConnectionPool`` to get a hint on whether all allocatable stream are busy.
- Removed unused code from older version of urllib3-future ``HTTPProtocolFactory.has(...)`` and ``ResolverFactory.has(...)``.
- Fixed using "very-specific" scheme for supported web extension like ``ws+wsproto://...`` for ws=plain websocket and wsproto=implementation.
- Reworking the test suite to revamp our coverage target toward 100%.

2.12.902 (2024-12-06)
=====================

- Fixed a rare issue where Happy-Eyeballs algorithm would not respect timeout for a plain HTTP connection where all available endpoints are unreachable.
- Fixed an issue where a HTTP/2 idle connection would be considered "used/saturated" instead of "idle" when remote expressed wish to goaway.
  This issue can lead to a ``traffic_police.OverwhelmedTraffic`` in synchronous context and indefinite hang in asynchronous after awhile.
- Increased default keepalive window to 1h by default for HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.

2.12.901 (2024-12-04)
=====================

- Fixed a thread/task safety issue when closing a SSE extension.
- Fixed a rare case when closing a connection would hang forever in Python 3.8, and 3.9 due to a bug in a "wait for close" internal procedure.
- Improved tests runtime and performance.

2.12.900 (2024-11-28)
=====================

- Added built-in support for Server-Side-Event (or SSE) via a WebExtension.
  It is as simple as doing ``pm.urlopen("GET", "sse://sse.dev/test")``. ``sse`` is using https under the hood by default.
  To force SSE via plain HTTP, replace ``sse://`` by ``psse://``.
  The ``extension`` attribute of produced response will be set, and you will be able to consume event promptly.
  See the documentation to learn more.
- Fixed unintentional regression using ``CONNECT`` verb manually outside of its standard usage.
- Fixed using a WebExtension with ``urlopen(..., multiplexed=True)`` from a PoolManager instance.

2.11.912 (2024-11-26)
=====================

- Improved timeout reliability and performance in asynchronous mode.
- Fixed PyPy discrete background watcher stop condition in synchronous mode when the ConnectionPool isn't closed properly.
- Fixed lack of timeout using default system resolver in asynchronous mode.
- Fixed a rare issue when connection tear down ran into an exception in Windows proactor loop mode. ssltransport is freed before what we initially expected.
- Improved reliability of DNS-over-QUIC, and DNS-over-TLS.

2.11.911 (2024-11-14)
=====================

- Improved support for async I/O data reader.
- Fixed non-respect of blocksize when uploading a body in an asynchronous context.

2.11.910 (2024-11-08)
=====================

- Improved reliability of reusing a specific outgoing port. The feature is no longer experimental.

2.11.909 (2024-11-07)
=====================

- Fixed DNS-over-QUIC, DNS-over-TLS, and DNS-over-UDP(Cleartext) connection procedure on network that lacks IPv6 access.
- Fixed DNS-over-TLS unstable over a slow network.
- Fixed a bug when setting a specific port in ``source_address`` and setting ``happy_eyeballs=True``.
  We now silently discard the specific port to avoid a conflict / race condition with OS outgoing port allocation.
- Improved reliability of our tests and fixed warnings in them.
- Preemptively disabled QUIC (HTTP/3 included) with interpreter built with FIPS-compliant SSL module.
  Our QUIC implementation isn't FIPS-compliant for the moment. To force using non-FIPS QUIC implementation,
  please patch ``urllib3.util.ssl_.IS_FIPS`` and set it to ``False``.
- Fixed DoQ default certs loading as done in DoT, and DoH.
- Improved reusability of a specific outgoing port. This is still an experimental feature, it is
  likely that CPython have a bug that prevent consistent behavior for this.

2.11.908 (2024-11-03)
=====================

- Fixed async connection shutdown in HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 leaving a ``asyncio.TransportSocket`` and ``_SelectorSocketTransport`` partially closed.
- Added automatic mitigation of using deprecated ``PROTOCOL_TLS_*`` constants in ``ssl_version`` parameter.

2.11.907 (2024-10-30)
=====================

- Fixed attempt to send ping frame in our discrete background idle watcher when the connection has just been closed.

2.11.906 (2024-10-26)
=====================

- Fixed unexpected exception when recreating a connection using the same outgoing port.
  Add ``SO_REUSEPORT`` if available, fallback to ``SO_REUSEADDR``. This socket option
  is not bullet proof against reusability errors. Some OS differs in behaviors.

2.11.905 (2024-10-26)
=====================

- Fixed custom loop like uvloop needing advanced error handling on transport close.
- Fixed MacOS connection reset by peer handling to detect connection close (continuation of fix in 2.11.902)

2.11.904 (2024-10-25)
=====================

- Improve (async) close procedure when used in a ``uvloop``.

2.11.903 (2024-10-22)
=====================

- Fixed (low-level) exception leak when using ``get_response(...)`` after ``urlopen(..., multiplexed=True)``.
- Fixed erroneous calculated maximal wait when starting a connection upgrade to a higher protocol version in rare cases (async+windows only).

2.11.902 (2024-10-22)
=====================

- Added viable replacement for connection close detection since we stopped using the function ``wait_for_read``
  in property ``is_connected`` of a ``HTTPConnection`` object. And we harmonized the behavior whether you use async
  or sync.

2.11.901 (2024-10-21)
=====================

- Fixed error in ``is_connected`` for a Connection. The logic is no longer applicable due to how urllib3-future grows.
  We no longer use the function ``wait_for_read``. Also we stopped using MSG_PEEK for our discrete incoming data watcher
  due to suspicious behavior noticed. Finally we shielded any exception from attempting to close a broken socket.

2.11.900 (2024-10-21)
=====================

- Added a discrete task for each instantiated ``ConnectionPool`` to watch for unsolicited incoming data.
  This improves the fix shipped in v2.10.906 and avoid having to recycle your multiplexed connection in idle moments.
  A new keyword argument is supported in your PoolManager configuration, namely ``background_watch_delay``.
  This parameter takes a int or float as the delay between checks. Set it to None to void this background task.
  Anything lower than ``0.01`` will be interpreted as None, therefor disabling the discrete watch.
- Added managed keepalive for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 over QUIC. A new keyword argument, named ``keepalive_delay`` that
  takes a value expressed in seconds for how long urllib3-future should automatically keep the connection alive.
  This is done in direct extension to our "discrete task" mentioned just before. We will send ``PING`` frame
  automatically to the remote peer every 60s by default (after idle for 60s to be clear). The window delay for
  sending a ``PING`` is configurable via the ``keepalive_idle_window`` parameter. Learn more about this in our
  documentation.
- Fixed evaluation of ``fp`` in our ``LowLevelResponse`` instance to raise ``AttributeError`` when it cannot be
  accessed. This will help with ``cachecontrol[filecache]`` way of determining if response was consumed entirely.

2.10.906 (2024-10-17)
=====================

- Fixed handling aggressive ACKs watcher in some QUIC server implementation leading to a ``ProtocolError``.
  We're actively working toward a solution that will avoid to recycle the QUIC connection.

2.10.905 (2024-10-15)
=====================

- Fixed dangling task waiting for timeout when using Happy Eyeballs in a synchronous context.

2.10.904 (2024-10-13)
=====================

- Fixed thread/task safety with WebSocket R/W operations.
- Fixed missing propagation of callbacks (e.g. ``on_post_connection``) in retries of failed requests.

2.10.903 (2024-10-12)
=====================

- Fixed exception leaks in ExtensionFromHTTP plugins. Now every extension behave and raise urllib3 own exceptions.
- Added automatic connection downgrade HTTP/2 -> HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/3 -> (HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1) in case of known recoverable issues.
- Fixed a rare issue where the write semaphore (async context) for a datagram socket would be locked forever in case of an error.

2.10.902 (2024-10-09)
=====================

- Fixed call to ``stream(..)`` on (early) informational responses. The inner ``fp`` was set to ``None`` and the function
  ``is_fp_closed`` is not meant to handle this case. Through you should never expect a body in those responses.
- Fixed ``read()``, and ``data`` returns None for (early) informational responses.

2.10.901 (2024-10-08)
=====================

- Fixed closed state on a WebSocketExtensionFromHTTP when the remote send a CloseConnection event.
- Fixed an edge case where a DNS-over-HTTPS would start of a non-multiplexed connection but immediately upgrade to a
  multiplexed capable connection would induce an error.
- Allow to disable HTTP/1.1 in a DNS-over-HTTPS resolver.
- Extra "qh3" lower bound aligned with the main constraint ``>=1.2,<2``.

2.10.900 (2024-10-06)
=====================

- Added complete support for Informational Response whether it's an early response or not. We introduced a callback named
  ``on_early_response`` that takes exactly one parameter, namely a ``HTTPResponse``. You may start leveraging Early Hints!
  This works regardless of the negotiated protocol: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3! As always, you may use that feature
  in a synchronous or asynchronous context.
- Changed ``qh3`` lower bound version to v1.2 in order to support Informational Response in HTTP/3 also.
- Added full automated support for WebSocket through HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
  In order to leverage this feature, urllib3-future now recognize url scheme ``ws://`` (insecure) and ``wss://`` (secure).
  The response will be of status 101 (Switching Protocol) and the body will be None.
  Most servers out there only support WebSocket through HTTP/1.1, and using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 usually ends up in stream (reset) error.
  By default, connecting to ``wss://`` or ``ws://`` use HTTP/1.1, but if you desire to leverage the WebSocket through a multiplexed connection,
  use ``wss+rfc8441://`` or ``ws+rfc8441://``.
  A new property has been introduced in ``HTTPResponse``, namely ``extension`` to be able to interact with the websocket
  server. Everything is handled automatically, from thread safety to all the protocol logic. See the documentation for more.
  This will require the installation of an optional dependency ``wsproto``, to do so, please install urllib3-future with
  ``pip install urllib3-future[ws]``.
- Fixed a rare issue where the ``:authority`` (special header) value might be malformed.

2.9.900 (2024-09-24)
====================

- Fixed a rare issue where HTTPS record is misinterpreted, thus leading to a missed preemptive HTTP/3 negotiation.
- Restored support for older-and-deprecated ``PySocks`` if installed and ``python-socks`` is absent for synchronous support of SOCKS proxies.
- Added support for HTTP Trailers across HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 responses. We added the property ``trailers`` in ``HTTPResponse`` to reflect that.
- Fixed unclosed resource warning for socket created in asynchronous mode.
- Added support for Upgrading to HTTP/2 (If coming from HTTP/1) via Alt-Svc. Whether it's h2c (http/2 over cleartext) or h2.
- Largely improve download speed on the QUIC layer by increasing automatically the blocksize to the largest value allowed on UDP (value taken from sysconf).
- Fixed the test suite outcome if no support for HTTP/3 exist in current environment.

2.8.907 (2024-08-20)
====================

- Fixed http2 maximum frame size error when the remote explicitly set a lower value than the default blocksize.
  This can happen when facing an Apache (httpd) server see https://github.com/apache/httpd/commit/ff6b8026acb8610e4faf10ee345141a3da85946e
  Now we monitor the max_frame setting value to ensure we don't exceed it.

2.8.906 (2024-08-15)
====================

- Removed opinionated OpenSSL version constraint that forbid any version lower than 1.1.1.
  The reasoning behind this is that some companies expressed (to us) the need to upgrade urllib3 to urllib3-future
  in (very) old Python 3.7 built against patched OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.0.8 and collaborative testing showed us
  that this constraint is overly protective. Those build often lack TLS 1.3 support and may contain
  major vulnerabilities, but we have to be optimistic on their awareness.
  TLS 1.3 / QUIC is also an option for them as it works out of the box on those old distributions.
  Effective immediately, we added a dedicated pipeline in our CI to verify that urllib3-future works
  with the oldest Python 3.7 build we found out there.
  Blindly removing support for those libraries when supporting Python 3.7 ... 3.9 is as we "partially"
  support this range and end-users have no to little clues for why it's rejected when it clearly works.
  The only issue that can appear is for users that have Python built against a SSL library that does not
  support either TLS 1.2 or 1.3, they will encounter errors for sure.
- Changed to submodule http2 to subpackage http2. Purely upstream sync. Still no use for us.
- Changed minimum (C)Python interpreter version for qh3 automatic pickup to 3.7.11 as it bundle pip 21.2.4 and
  is the minimum version to pick an appropriate (abi3) pre-built wheel. You may still install ``qh3`` manually
  by first upgrading your pip installation by running ``python -m pip install -U pip``.
- Fixed an issue where a server is yielding an invalid/malformed ``Alt-Svc`` header and urllib3-future may crash upon it.
- Fixed an issue where sending a ``str`` body using a ``bytes`` value for Content-Type would induce a crash.
  This was due to our unicode transparency policy. See https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/pull/142

2.8.905 (2024-08-04)
====================

- Fixed wrong upgrade attempt to QUIC when using a SOCKS proxy. Any usage of a proxy disable HTTP/3 over QUIC as per documented.
  until proper support is implemented in a next minor version.
- Backported upstream urllib3 #3434: util/ssl: make code resilient to missing hash functions.
  In certain environments such as in a FIPS enabled system, certain algorithms such as md5 may be unavailable. Due
  to the importing of such a module on a system where it is unavailable, urllib3(-future) will crash and is unusable.
  https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/3434
- Backported upstream urllib3 GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf: Strip Proxy-Authorization header on redirects.
  Added the ``Proxy-Authorization`` header to the list of headers to strip from requests when redirecting to a different host.
  As before, different headers can be set via ``Retry.remove_headers_on_redirect``.
- Fixed state-machine desync on a rare scenario when uploading a body using HTTP/3 over QUIC.

2.8.904 (2024-07-18)
====================

- Relaxed h11 constraint around "pending proposal" and coming server event about upgrade.
  This is made to ensure near perfect compatibility against the legacy urllib3 which is based on http.client.
- Fixed h11 yielding bytearray instead of bytes in rare circumstances.
- Added ``docker-py`` in our CI/integration pipeline.

2.8.903 (2024-07-17)
====================

- Added ``IS_PYOPENSSL`` constant that is exposed by upstream in ``urllib3.util.ssl_`` submodule.
- Fixed missing exception (``ImportError``) when importing ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` when PyOpenSSL isn't present in environment.
- Lowered and simplified testing requirements for HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.
- Added ``boto3``, ``sphinx``, and ``requests`` to our downstream test cases (nox).

2.8.902 (2024-07-07)
====================

- Added support for async iterable yielding either bytes or str when passing a body into your requests.
- Added dummy module (e.g. http2 and emscriptem) like upstream without serving any of them. Those modules won't be served and are empty as we diverged since.
- Added a better error message for http3 handshake failure to help out users figuring out what is happening.
- Added official support for Python 3.13

2.8.901 (2024-06-27)
====================

- Improved compatibility with httplib exception for ``IncompleteRead`` that did not behave exactly like expected (repr/str format over it).
- The metric TLS handshake delay was wrongfully set when using HTTP/2 over cleartext.
- Fixed compatibility with some third-party mocking library that are injecting io.BytesIO in HTTPResponse.
  In some cases, ``IncompleteRead`` might not be raised like expected.

2.8.900 (2024-06-24)
====================

- Support for HTTP/2 with prior knowledge over non-encrypted connection to leverage multiplexing in internal networks.
  To leverage this feature, you have to disable HTTP/1.1 so that `urllib3-future` can infer your intent.
  Disabling HTTP/1.1 is to be made as follow: ``PoolManager(disabled_svn={HttpVersion.h11})``.
- Added raw data bytes counter in ``LowLevelResponse`` to help end-users track download speed accordingly if they use
  brotli, gzip or zstd transfer-encoding during downloads.

2.7.914 (2024-06-15)
====================

- Further improved compatibility with some third party programs that accessed hazardous materials within http.client standard library.
- Add "ARM64" architecture for qh3 automatic installation on Windows.

2.7.913 (2024-05-31)
====================

- Relaxed constraints around ``HTTPConnectionPool._new_conn`` private method in order to ensure a broader compatibility. (#122)

2.7.912 (2024-05-27)
====================

- Fixed unset ``tls_version`` within ``ConnectionInfo`` when using the legacy TLSv1 protocol.
- Fixed license metadata SPDX in package.
- Fixed custom ssl context with ``OP_NO_TLSv1_3`` option that did not disable HTTP/3.
- Fixed custom ssl context with ``assert_hostname=False`` parameter not forwarded to QUIC configuration.

2.7.911 (2024-05-24)
====================

- Fixed the ability to override properly the ``:authority`` special header via the legacy ``Host`` header.

2.7.910 (2024-05-22)
====================

- Removed workaround for a bug that existed in qh3 < 1.0 with cryptography in a concurrent (thread) environment.
- Avoid loading qh3 at runtime in order to improve import delay. It was used to probe HTTP/3 support. We compute it lazily from now on.
- Added the possibility to use the ``preemptive_quic_cache`` MutableMapping to exclude endpoints.
  If your implementation discard the recently set key/entry it will prevent the connection from upgrading itself.

2.7.909 (2024-05-17)
====================

- Improve (large) data download performance by increasing the default blocksize.
- Improve HTTP/1.1 performance by reducing the amount of time we want to infer "if next cycle" should be triggered.

2.7.908 (2024-05-16)
====================

- Improve ``traffic_state_of`` function to improve the overall performance in a highly concurrent context.

2.7.907 (2024-05-05)
====================

- Passing a ssl context containing manually loaded root certificates no longer is ignored with HTTP/3 over QUIC.

2.7.906 (2024-05-02)
====================

- Overall performance improvement with HTTP/2 in a highly concurrent context.

2.7.905 (2024-04-28)
====================

- Added support for ``jh2>=5,<6`` instead of ``h2~=4.0`` as a drop-in replacement.
  Expect a significant performance improvement with HTTP/2. We successfully reduced our dependency footprint to the minimum.

2.7.904 (2024-04-20)
====================

- Added support for qh3 version v1
- **Security:** Fixed ignored DNS matching with its certificate in certain conditions while negotiating HTTP/3 over QUIC

2.7.903 (2024-04-04)
====================

- Removed warning about "unresponsive" pool of connection due to how it can confuse users.

2.7.902 (2024-04-03)
====================

- Fixed a rare racing condition occurring on PyPy when using DNS-over-HTTPS leading to a socket.gaierror exception.
- Fixed retrieving the dict peer certificate when ``cert_reqs=0`` aka. disabled TLS over TCP verification.

2.7.901 (2024-03-27)
====================

- Fixed an edge case with Response::read() confusing situation where passing a positive amount to read then
  passing ``None`` n-times would continuously return cached data if the stream was closed (content consumed).
- Fixed IncompleteRead exception property ``expected`` that did not contain the "remaining" amount expected but rather
  the total expected.

2.7.900 (2024-03-25)
====================

- Added Happy-Eyeballs support.
  This feature is disabled by default, you can enable it by passing ``happy_eyeballs=True``
  into ``AsyncPoolManager``, ``AsyncHTTPConnectionPool`` or its synchronous counterparts.
  See the documentation to learn more.
- Fixed an issue where passing a IPv6 address to the in-memory resolver provider would be improperly registered.
- Fixed unclosed socket when the user attempt to set a impossible port to bind on (i.e. not in range 0-65535) leading to a ResourceWarning.
- Fixed a rare issue with DNS-over-HTTPS where a HTTPS record would also be interpreted as a normal record.

2.6.906 (2024-03-18)
====================

- Fixed SSL context cache construction that did not take key_password into account.
- Prefer return ``NotImplemented`` instead of raising ``NotImplementedError`` to avoid polluting the stack trace when trying to
  initialize the external tls layer when not concerned (e.g. not http3 over QUIC).

2.6.905 (2024-03-17)
====================

- Fixed traffic police shutdown procedure to avoid killing needlessly a new connection or pool.

2.6.904 (2024-03-17)
====================

- Overall performance improvements for both async and sync calls.
- Removed ``TrafficPolice`` internal caching for obj states of contained elements due to its inability to be up-to-date in some cases.
- Fixed SSLError wrong message displayed when using the underlying ``qh3`` library (HTTP/3 only).
- Fixed graceful shutdown for rare HTTP/2 servers configured to immediately forbid opening new streams.

2.6.903 (2024-03-10)
====================

- Overall performance improvements for both async and sync calls.

2.6.902 (2024-03-04)
====================

- Fixed PyPy error when running asynchronous code on Windows after trying to create a datagram socket.
  This error is due to an incomplete implementation of the Windows socket API. We silently disabled HTTP/3
  if running PyPy+Windows+asyncio until upstream issue resolution.
- Overall performance improvements for both async and sync calls.
- Fixed ProtocolError (No recent network activity after XYZ) error when it should recycle the connection automatically (sync only).
- Added a user-friendly error message when invoking ``get_response`` from either ``PoolManager`` or ``ConnectionPool`` with anything
  else than a ``ResponsePromise``.

2.6.901 (2024-02-28)
====================

- Fixed blocking IO just after HTTP/3 is negotiated in an asynchronous context.
- Added explicit warning in case your pool of connections is insufficiently sized for the given charge in an asynchronous context.
- Fixed automatic retrieval of the issuer certificate in an asynchronous context (``ConnectionInfo``).

2.6.900 (2024-02-26)
====================

- Added full asynchronous support using asyncio.
  urllib3.future officially support asyncio as his asynchronous scheduler.
  The following public classes are immediately available:

  ``AsyncPoolManager``, ``AsyncHTTPConnectionPool``, ``AsyncHTTPSConnectionPool``, ``AsyncProxyManager``,
  ``AsyncResolverDescription``.

  Finally, bellow functions are also available:

  ``async_proxy_from_url``, and ``async_connection_from_url``.

  Explore the documentation section about async to learn more about this awesome feature with detailed
  examples. No extra dependencies are required. We rely exclusively on the standard library.

  Async SOCKS proxies are also supported at no additional costs with ``contrib.socks.AsyncSOCKSProxyManager``.

2.5.904 (2024-02-21)
====================

- Improved reliability with PoliceTraffic.borrow with type as indicator when heavily accessed by many threads.

2.5.903 (2024-02-20)
====================

- Fixed an edge case where a simultaneous call to ``get_response()`` without a specific promise could lead to a non-thread safe operation.

2.5.902 (2024-02-04)
====================

- Fixed missed cleanup of unused PoolKey stored in ``PoliceTraffic`` upon a full ``PoolManager``.

2.5.901 (2024-02-02)
====================

- Fixed a compatibility issue with ``boto3`` when trying to send data (got an unexpected keyword argument). #79

2.5.900 (2024-02-02)
====================

- Improved performance and reliability for concurrent streams handled by a single connection.
  We relied on a flat array of events generated by the protocol state-machine that unfortunately was not
  efficient. urllib3-future now handle the events with a matrix/multi-dimensional array bound to time.
- Fixed a thread safety issue when a single multiplexed connection was used across many threads.
  We revised in-depth the logic wrapper around the connection locking to make sure you may
  go all-in when using threads in that particular context. In consequence to that:
  1) We are, effective immediately, deprecating ``RecentlyUsedContainer``
  in favor of our internal ``PoliceTraffic`` that was used in ``PoolManager``.
  2) No longer using ``Queue`` to manage the ``Connection`` in ``HTTPConnectionPool``.
  If you try to set ``HTTPConnectionPool.QueueCls`` it will raise a deprecation warning.
  Starting today, we no longer accept implementation like ``queue.Queue`` because it
  cannot fit the need of this complex HTTP client, especially with the multiplexing aspect.
- Increased default pool maxsize for DNS-over-HTTPS from 1 to 10.

2.4.906 (2024-01-19)
====================

- Fixed a rare case of HTTP/3 being disabled when forwarding a custom SSLContext created.
- Re-introduce ``DEFAULT_CIPHERS`` constant in ``urllib3.util.ssl_`` due to the demands.
  It contains the Mozilla recommended cipher suite that was introduced in version 2.2.900.
- Fixed handling of OpenSSL 3.2.0 new error message for misconfiguring an HTTP proxy as HTTPS.
  Ported from urllib3/3271.
- Fixed ``request_sent_latency`` that wasn't computed when request was stopped early (prior to sending the
  complete body).

2.4.905 (2024-01-16)
====================

- Fixed an edge case where a HTTPS record was misinterpreted when using a DNS-over-HTTPS resolver.

2.4.904 (2024-01-15)
====================

- Fixed an issue where a idle QUIC connection would not be recycled properly when expired.
- Added support for passing ``-1`` as the **amt** in ``HTTPResponse`` (read, or stream) as the strict equivalent of ``read1``.
  This allows you to fetch content as soon as it arrive.
- Removed orphaned method ``_handle_chunk``, ``_update_chunk_length`` from ``HTTPResponse``.
- Fixed the iterator in ``HTTPResponse`` that hung until the complete content was downloaded.

2.4.903 (2024-01-07)
====================

- Fixed an issue where setting None for a header value could cause an exception.

2.4.902 (2024-01-01)
====================

- Fixed compatibility with older PyPy 3.7 interpreters when HTTP/3 (qh3) can be unavailable.
- Fixed undesired DGRAM/QUIC preemptive upgrade using insecure protocol.

2.4.901 (2023-12-31)
====================

- Fixed an issue where a stateless resolver (e.g. nullresolver) could not be recycled.
- Fixed an issue where one would attempt to close a resolver multiple times.

2.4.900 (2023-12-30)
====================

- Added issuer certificate extraction from SSLSocket with native calls with Python 3.10+ in ``ConnectionInfo``.
- Added support for DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTPS, DNS over QUIC, DNS over UDP, and local hosts-like DNS.
  ``PoolManager``, and ``HTTPPoolManager`` constructor now expose an additional keyword argument, ``resolver=...``.
  You can assign to it one of the presented protocol. Also, you may chain a list of resolver, each resolver can be
  limited to a list of host-pattern or not. Default is the system DNS. This new feature is covered by our thread-safety
  promise.

  You can now do the following: ``PoolManage(resolver="doh://dns.google")`` for example.
  Refer to the official documentation to learn about the full capabilities.
- Support for SOCKS proxies is now provided by `python-socks` instead of `PySocks` due to being largely
  unmaintained within a reasonable period of time. This change is made completely transparent.
- Added details in ``ConnectionInfo`` about detailed timings and others details.
  ``established_latency`` is a _timedelta_ that represent the amount of time consumed to get an ESTABLISHED network link.
  ``resolution_latency`` is a _timedelta_ that represent the amount of time consumed for the hostname resolution.
  ``tls_handshake_latency`` is a _timedelta_ that represent the amount of time consumed for the TLS handshake.
  ``request_sent_latency`` is a _timedelta_ that represent the amount of time consumed to encode and send the whole request through the socket.
- Fixed a rare thread safety issue when using at least one HTTP/3 multiplexed connection.
- Deprecated function ``util.connection.create_connection(..)`` in favor of newly added ``contrib.resolver`` that will
  host from now on that function within ``BaseResolver`` as a method. Users are encouraged to migrate as soon as possible.
- Support for preemptively negotiating HTTP/3 over QUIC based on RFC 9460 via a HTTPS DNS record.
- Added support for enforcing IPv6, and/or IPv4 using the keyword parameter ``socket_family`` that can be provided in
  ``PoolManager``, ``HTTP(S)ConnectionPool`` and ``HTTP(S)Connection``. The three accepted values are ``socket.AF_UNSPEC``
  ``socket.AF_INET``, and ``socket.AF_INET6``. Respectively, allow all, ipv4 only, and ipv6 only. Anything else will raise
  **ValueError**.

2.3.902 (2023-12-08)
====================

- Fixed an issue where specifying `cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE` or `assert_hostname` was ignored when using HTTP/3 over QUIC.

2.3.901 (2023-11-26)
====================

- Small performance improvement while in HTTP/1.1
- Any string passed down to the body will enforce a default ``Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`` for safety, unless
  you specified a ``Content-Type`` header yourself. The ``charset`` parameter will always be set to ``utf-8``.
  It is recommended that you pass ``bytes`` instead of a plain string. If a conflicting charset has been set that
  does not refer to utf-8, a warning will be raised.
- Added callable argument in ``urlopen``, and ``request`` named ``on_upload_body`` that enable you to track
  body upload progress for a single request. It takes 4 positional arguments, namely:
  (total_sent: int, total_to_be_sent: int | None, is_completed: bool, any_error: bool)
  total_to_be_sent may be set to None if we're unable to know in advance the total size (blind iterator/generator).
- Fixed a rare case where ``ProtocolError`` was raised instead of expected ``IncompleteRead`` exception.
- Improved HTTP/3 overall performance.
- Changed the default max connection per host for (http, https) pools managed by ``PoolManager``.
  If the ``PoolManager`` is instantiated with ``num_pools=10``, each (managed) subsequent pool will have ``maxsize=10``.
- Improved performance while in a multithreading context while using many multiplexed connections.
- Changed the default max saturated multiplexed connections to 64 as the minimum.
  Now a warning will be fired if you reach the maximum capacity of stored saturated multiplexed connections.

2.3.900 (2023-11-18)
====================

- Disabled unsafe renegotiation option with TLS by default where applicable.
- Added fallback package ``urllib3_future`` in addition to ``urllib3``.
  This became increasingly needed as a significant number of projects requires ``urllib3`` and
  accidentally override this fork.

2.2.907 (2023-11-11)
====================

- Reverted relying on ``qh3`` to dynamically retrieve the max concurrent streams allowed before connection saturation.

2.2.906 (2023-11-11)
====================

- Bumped minimum requirement for ``qh3`` to version 0.14.0 in order to drop private calls in ``contrib.hface.protocols._qh3``.
- Cache last 1024 ``parse_url`` function call as it is costly.
- Fixed incomplete flow control window checks while sending data in HTTP/2.
- Fixed unexpected BrokenPipeError exception in a rare edge case.
- Changed behavior for efficiency around ``socket.recv`` to pull ``conn.blocksize`` bytes regardless of ``Response.read(amt=...)``.

2.2.905 (2023-11-08)
====================

- Fixed loss of a QUIC connection due to an inappropriate check in ``conn.is_connected``.
- Separate saturated (multiplexed) connections from the main pool to a distinct one.

2.2.904 (2023-11-06)
====================

- Fixed concurrent/multiplexed request overflow in a full connection pool.
- Fixed connection close that had in-flight request (in multiplexed mode), the connection appeared as not idle on clean reuse.

2.2.903 (2023-11-06)
====================

- Improved overall performances in HTTP/2, and HTTP/3, with or without multiplexed.

2.2.902 (2023-11-05)
====================

- Fixed QUIC connection not taking ``cert_data`` due to an accidental variable override.

2.2.901 (2023-11-04)
====================

- Fixed several issues with multiplexing.
  (i) Fixed max concurrent streams in HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.
  (ii) Fixed tracking of unconsumed response prior to try upgrade the connection (to HTTP/3).
  (iii) Fixed (always) releasing multiplexed connections into pool.
  (iv) Fixed request having body being interrupted by the ``EarlyResponse`` exception 'signal'.

2.2.900 (2023-11-01)
====================

- Added support for in-memory client (intermediary) certificate to be used with mTLS.
  This feature compensate for the complete removal of ``pyOpenSSL``. Unfortunately it is only
  available on Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD. Using newly added ``cert_data`` and ``key_data`` arguments
  in ``HTTPSConnection`` and ``HTTPSPoolConnection`` you will be capable of passing the certificate along with
  its key without getting nowhere near your filesystem.
  MacOS and Windows are not concerned by this feature when using HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 with TLS over TCP.
- Removed remnant ``SSLTransport.makefile`` as it was built to circumvent a legacy constraint when urllib3 depended upon
  ``http.client``.
- Bumped minimum requirement for ``qh3`` to version 0.13.0 in order to support in-memory client certificate (mTLS).
- Symbolic complete detachment from ``http.client``. Removed all references and imports to ``http.client``. Farewell!
- Changed the default ciphers in default SSLContext for an **increased** security level.
  *Rational:* Earlier in v2.1.901 we initialized the SSLContext ciphers with the value ``DEFAULT`` but after much
  consideration, after we saw that the associated ciphers (e.g. ``DEFAULT`` from OpenSSL) includes some weak suites
  we decided to inject a rather safer and limited cipher suite. It is based on https://ssl-config.mozilla.org
  Starting now, urllib3.future will match Mozilla cipher recommendations (intermediary) and will regularly update the suite.
- Added support for multiplexed connection. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 can benefit from this.
  urllib3.future no longer blocks when ``urlopen(...)`` is invoked using ``multiplexed=True``, and return
  a ``ResponsePromise`` instead of a ``HTTPResponse``. You may dispatch as much requests as the protocol
  permits you (concurrent stream) and then retrieve the response(s) using the ``get_response(...)``.
  ``get_response(...)`` can take up to one kwarg to specify the target promise, if none specified, will retrieve
  the first available response. ``multiplexed`` is set to False by default and will likely be the default for a long
  time.
  Here is an example::

    from urllib3 import PoolManager

    with PoolManager() as pm:
        promise0 = pm.urlopen("GET", "https://pie.dev/delay/3", multiplexed=True)
        # <ResponsePromise 'IOYTFooi0bCuaQ9mwl4HaA==' HTTP/2.0 Stream[1]>
        promise1 = pm.urlopen("GET", "https://pie.dev/delay/1", multiplexed=True)
        # <ResponsePromise 'U9xT9dPVGnozL4wzDbaA3w==' HTTP/2.0 Stream[3]>
        response0 = pm.get_response()
        # the second request arrived first
        response0.json()["url"]  # https://pie.dev/delay/1
        # the first arrived last
        response1 = pm.get_response()
        response1.json()["url"]  # https://pie.dev/delay/3

  or you may do::

    from urllib3 import PoolManager

    with PoolManager() as pm:
        promise0 = pm.urlopen("GET", "https://pie.dev/delay/3", multiplexed=True)
        # <ResponsePromise 'IOYTFooi0bCuaQ9mwl4HaA==' HTTP/2.0 Stream[1]>
        promise1 = pm.urlopen("GET", "https://pie.dev/delay/1", multiplexed=True)
        # <ResponsePromise 'U9xT9dPVGnozL4wzDbaA3w==' HTTP/2.0 Stream[3]>
        response0 = pm.get_response(promise=promise0)
        # forcing retrieving promise0
        response0.json()["url"]  # https://pie.dev/delay/3
        # then pick first available
        response1 = pm.get_response()
        response1.json()["url"]  # https://pie.dev/delay/1

  You may do multiplexing using ``PoolManager``, and ``HTTPSPoolConnection``. Connection upgrade
  to HTTP/3 cannot be done until all in-flight requests are completed.
  Be aware that a non-capable connection (e.g. HTTP/1.1) will just ignore the ``multiplexed=True`` setting
  and act traditionally.
- Connection are now released into their respective pool when the connection support multiplexing (HTTP/2, HTTP/3)
  before the response has been consumed. This allows to have multiple response half-consumed from a single connection.

2.1.903 (2023-10-23)
====================

- Removed ``BaseHTTPConnection``, and ``BaseHTTPSConnection``.
  Rationale: The initial idea, as far as I understand it, was to create a ``HTTPSConnection`` per protocols, e.g.
  HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. From the point of view of ``urllib3.future`` it was taken care of in ``contrib.hface``
  where the protocols state-machines are handled. We plan to always have a unified ``Connection`` class that
  regroup all protocols for convenience. The private module ``urllib3._base_connection`` is renamed to ``urllib3._typing``.
  It brings a lot of simplification, which is welcomed.
- Reduced ``BaseHTTPResponse`` to a mere alias of ``HTTPResponse`` for the same reasoning as before. There is absolutely
  no need whatsoever in the foreseeable future to ship urllib3.future with an alternative implementation of ``HTTPResponse``.
  It will be removed in a future major.
- Removed ``RECENT_DATE`` and linked logic as it does not make sense to (i) maintain it (ii) the certificate verification
  failure won't be avoided anyway, so it is a warning prior to an unavoidable error. The warning class ``SystemTimeWarning``
  will be removed in a future major.
- Added support for stopping sending body if the server responded early in HTTP/2, or HTTP/3.
  This can happen when a server says that you exhausted the size limit or if previously sent
  headers were rejected for example. This should save a lot of time to users in given cases.
- Refactored scattered typing aliases across the sources. ``urllib3._typing`` now contain all of our definitions.
- Avoid installation of ``qh3`` in PyPy 3.11+ while pre-built wheels are unavailable.

2.1.902 (2023-10-21)
====================

- Fixed an issue where streaming response did not yield data until the stream was closed.
- Unified peercert/issuercert dict output in ConnectionInfo output format when HTTP/3.
- Made body stripped from HTTP requests changing the request method to GET after HTTP 303 "See Other" redirect responses.
  Headers ``content-encoding, content-language, content-location, content-type, content-length, digest, last-modified`` are
  also stripped in the said case.
  Port of the security fix GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4
- ``_TYPE_BODY`` now accept `Iterable[str]` in addition to `Iterable[bytes]`.

2.1.901 (2023-10-10)
====================

- Set ``DEFAULT`` (as OpenSSL default list) for ciphers in SSLContext if none is provided instead of Python default.
- Fixed an edge case where chosen state machine would be indicated to not end stream where it should.
- Fixed a rare case where ``ProtocolError`` was raised instead of ``SSLError`` in the underlying QUIC layer state-machine.
- Small performance improvement in sending a body by removing an obsolete logic made for a removed constraint.
- Changed default ``User-Agent`` to ``urllib3.future/x.y.z``.
- Removed a compatibility operation that added a ``Content-Length`` header on request with unknown body length.
  This was present due to a bug in Traefik server. A investigation will be conducted and a relevant issue will be
  addressed.

2.1.900 (2023-10-07)
====================

- Added ``cipher`` in ``ConnectionInfo`` when using HTTP/3 over QUIC.
- Added ``issuer_certificate_der``, ``issuer_certificate_dict`` into ``ConnectionInfo``.

  By default, it is set to ``None``. This property is filled automatically on a QUIC connection.
  It cannot be done automatically when using native Python capabilities.

- Removed support for SecureTransport.
- Removed support for PyOpenSSL.

  This module is not delete but rendered ineffective. An explicit warning still appear.

- Improved automated exchange between the socket and the HTTP state machines.
- Removed all dependencies in the ``secure`` extra.
- Fixed disabling HTTP/3 over QUIC if specified settings were incompatible with TLS over QUIC.

  Previously if ``ssl_context`` was set and specifying a list of ciphers it was discarded on upgrade.
  Also, if ``ssl_maximum_version`` was set to TLS v1.2.
  Now those parameters are correctly forwarded to the custom QUIC/TLS layer.

- Fixed ``ConnectionInfo`` repr that did not shown the ``http_version`` property.
- Undeprecated 'ssl_version' option in create_urllib3_context.
- Undeprecated 'format_header_param_rfc2231'.
- Removed warning about the 'strict' parameter.
- Removed constant ``IS_PYOPENSSL`` and ``IS_SECURETRANSPORT`` from ``urllib3.utils``.
- Added raise warning when using environment variables ``SSLKEYLOGFILE``, and ``QUICLOGDIR``.
- Added the ``Cookie`` header to the list of headers to strip from requests when redirecting to a different host. As before, different headers can be set via ``Retry.remove_headers_on_redirect``.
- Removed warning about ssl not being the ``OpenSSL`` backend. You are free to choose.

  Users are simply encouraged to report issues if any to the jawah/urllib3.future repository.
  Support will be provided by the best of our abilities.

2.0.936 (2023-10-01)
====================

- Added support for event ``StreamReset`` to raise a ``ProtocolError`` when received from either h2 or h3. (`#28 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/28>`__)


2.0.935 (2023-10-01)
====================

- Fixed a violation in our QUIC transmission due to sending multiple datagram at once. (`#26 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/26>`__)


2.0.934 (2023-09-23)
====================

- Added public `ConnectionInfo` class that will be present in each `HttpConnection` instance.

  Passing the kwarg ``on_post_connection`` that accept a callable with a single positional argument
  in ``PoolManager.urlopen`` method will result in a call each time a connection is picked out
  of the pool. The function will be passed a ``ConnectionInfo`` object.
  The same argument (``on_post_connection``) can be passed down to the ``HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen`` method. (`#23 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/23>`__)

- `#22 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/22>`__


2.0.933 (2023-09-21)
====================

- Fixed ``HTTPSConnectionPool`` not accepting and forwarding ``ca_cert_data``. (`#20 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/20>`__)


2.0.932 (2023-09-12)
====================

- Fixed `assert_hostname` behavior when HTTPSConnection targets HTTP/3 over QUIC (`#8 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/8>`__)
- Fixed protocol violation for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 where we sent ``Connection: keep-alive`` when it is
  forbidden. (`#16 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/16>`__)
- Fixed ``unpack_chunk`` workaround function in the ``send`` method when body is multipart/form-data (`#17 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/17>`__)
- Fixed the flow control when sending a body for a HTTP/2 connection.
  The body will be split into numerous chunks if the size exceed the specified blocksize when not
  using HTTP/1.1 in order to avoid ProtocolError (flow control) (`#18 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/18>`__)


2.0.931 (2023-07-16)
====================

Features
--------

- Added experimental support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 independently of httplib.

  Currently urllib3 does not offer async http request and the backend is the http.client package
  shipped alongside Python. This implementation is not scheduled to improve, even less to support latest
  protocol.

  Without proxies, the negotiation is as follow:

  - http requests are always made using HTTP/1.1.
  - https requests are made with HTTP/2 if TLS-ALPN yield its support otherwise HTTP/1.1.

  - https requests may upgrade to HTTP/3 if latest response contain a valid Alt-Svc header.

  With proxies:

  - The initial proxy request is always issued using HTTP/1.1 regardless if its http or https.
  - Subsequents requests follow the previous section (Without proxies) at the sole exception that HTTP/3 upgrade is disabled.

  You may explicitly disable HTTP/2 or, and, HTTP/3 by passing ``disabled_svn={HttpVersion.h2}`` to your ``BaseHttpConnection`` instance.
  Disabling HTTP/1.1 is forbidden and raise an error.

  Note that a valid or accepted Alt-Svc header in urllib3 means looking for the "h3" (final specification) protocol and disallow switching hostname for security
  reasons. (`#1 <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future/issues/1>`__)
- Added ``BaseHTTPResponse`` to ``__all__`` in ``__init__.py`` (`#3078 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3078>`__)


2.0.3 (2023-06-07)
==================

- Allowed alternative SSL libraries such as LibreSSL, while still issuing a warning as we cannot help users facing issues with implementations other than OpenSSL. (`#3020 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3020>`__)
- Deprecated URLs which don't have an explicit scheme (`#2950 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2950>`_)
- Fixed response decoding with Zstandard when compressed data is made of several frames. (`#3008 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3008>`__)
- Fixed ``assert_hostname=False`` to correctly skip hostname check. (`#3051 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3051>`__)


2.0.2 (2023-05-03)
==================

- Fixed ``HTTPResponse.stream()`` to continue yielding bytes if buffered decompressed data
  was still available to be read even if the underlying socket is closed. This prevents
  a compressed response from being truncated. (`#3009 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3009>`__)


2.0.1 (2023-04-30)
==================

- Fixed a socket leak when fingerprint or hostname verifications fail. (`#2991 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2991>`__)
- Fixed an error when ``HTTPResponse.read(0)`` was the first ``read`` call or when the internal response body buffer was otherwise empty. (`#2998 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2998>`__)


2.0.0 (2023-04-26)
==================

Read the `v2.0 migration guide <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html>`__ for help upgrading to the latest version of urllib3.

Removed
-------

* Removed support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6 (`#883 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/883>`__, `#2336 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2336>`__).
* Removed fallback on certificate ``commonName`` in ``match_hostname()`` function.
  This behavior was deprecated in May 2000 in RFC 2818. Instead only ``subjectAltName``
  is used to verify the hostname by default. To enable verifying the hostname against
  ``commonName`` use ``SSLContext.hostname_checks_common_name = True`` (`#2113 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2113>`__).
* Removed support for Python with an ``ssl`` module compiled with LibreSSL, CiscoSSL,
  wolfSSL, and all other OpenSSL alternatives. Python is moving to require OpenSSL with PEP 644 (`#2168 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168>`__).
* Removed support for OpenSSL versions earlier than 1.1.1 or that don't have SNI support.
  When an incompatible OpenSSL version is detected an ``ImportError`` is raised (`#2168 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168>`__).
* Removed the list of default ciphers for OpenSSL 1.1.1+ and SecureTransport as their own defaults are already secure (`#2082 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2082>`__).
* Removed ``urllib3.contrib.appengine.AppEngineManager`` and support for Google App Engine Standard Environment (`#2044 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2044>`__).
* Removed deprecated ``Retry`` options ``method_whitelist``, ``DEFAULT_REDIRECT_HEADERS_BLACKLIST`` (`#2086 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2086>`__).
* Removed ``urllib3.HTTPResponse.from_httplib`` (`#2648 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2648>`__).
* Removed default value of ``None`` for the ``request_context`` parameter of ``urllib3.PoolManager.connection_from_pool_key``. This change should have no effect on users as the default value of ``None`` was an invalid option and was never used (`#1897 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1897>`__).
* Removed the ``urllib3.request`` module. ``urllib3.request.RequestMethods`` has been made a private API.
  This change was made to ensure that ``from urllib3 import request`` imported the top-level ``request()``
  function instead of the ``urllib3.request`` module (`#2269 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2269>`__).
* Removed support for SSLv3.0 from the ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` even when support is available from the compiled OpenSSL library (`#2233 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2233>`__).
* Removed the deprecated ``urllib3.contrib.ntlmpool`` module (`#2339 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2339>`__).
* Removed ``DEFAULT_CIPHERS``, ``HAS_SNI``, ``USE_DEFAULT_SSLCONTEXT_CIPHERS``, from the private module ``urllib3.util.ssl_`` (`#2168 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168>`__).
* Removed ``urllib3.exceptions.SNIMissingWarning`` (`#2168 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168>`__).
* Removed the ``_prepare_conn`` method from ``HTTPConnectionPool``. Previously this was only used to call ``HTTPSConnection.set_cert()`` by ``HTTPSConnectionPool`` (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Removed ``tls_in_tls_required`` property from ``HTTPSConnection``. This is now determined from the ``scheme`` parameter in ``HTTPConnection.set_tunnel()`` (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Removed the ``strict`` parameter/attribute from ``HTTPConnection``, ``HTTPSConnection``, ``HTTPConnectionPool``, ``HTTPSConnectionPool``, and ``HTTPResponse`` (`#2064 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2064>`__).

Deprecated
----------

* Deprecated ``HTTPResponse.getheaders()`` and ``HTTPResponse.getheader()`` which will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0. Instead use ``HTTPResponse.headers`` and ``HTTPResponse.headers.get(name, default)``. (`#1543 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1543>`__, `#2814 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2814>`__).
* Deprecated ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` module which will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0 (`#2691 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2691>`__).
* Deprecated ``urllib3.contrib.securetransport`` module which will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0 (`#2692 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2692>`__).
* Deprecated ``ssl_version`` option in favor of ``ssl_minimum_version``. ``ssl_version`` will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0 (`#2110 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2110>`__).
* Deprecated the ``strict`` parameter of ``PoolManager.connection_from_context()`` as it's not longer needed in Python 3.x. It will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0 (`#2267 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2267>`__)
* Deprecated the ``NewConnectionError.pool`` attribute which will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0 (`#2271 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2271>`__).
* Deprecated ``format_header_param_html5`` and ``format_header_param`` in favor of ``format_multipart_header_param`` (`#2257 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2257>`__).
* Deprecated ``RequestField.header_formatter`` parameter which will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0 (`#2257 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2257>`__).
* Deprecated ``HTTPSConnection.set_cert()`` method. Instead pass parameters to the ``HTTPSConnection`` constructor (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Deprecated ``HTTPConnection.request_chunked()`` method which will be removed in urllib3 v2.1.0. Instead pass ``chunked=True`` to ``HTTPConnection.request()`` (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).

Added
-----

* Added top-level ``urllib3.request`` function which uses a preconfigured module-global ``PoolManager`` instance (`#2150 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2150>`__).
* Added the ``json`` parameter to ``urllib3.request()``, ``PoolManager.request()``, and ``ConnectionPool.request()`` methods to send JSON bodies in requests. Using this parameter will set the header ``Content-Type: application/json`` if ``Content-Type`` isn't already defined.
  Added support for parsing JSON response bodies with ``HTTPResponse.json()`` method (`#2243 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2243>`__).
* Added type hints to the ``urllib3`` module (`#1897 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1897>`__).
* Added ``ssl_minimum_version`` and ``ssl_maximum_version`` options which set
  ``SSLContext.minimum_version`` and ``SSLContext.maximum_version`` (`#2110 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2110>`__).
* Added support for Zstandard (RFC 8878) when ``zstandard`` 1.18.0 or later is installed.
  Added the ``zstd`` extra which installs the ``zstandard`` package (`#1992 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1992>`__).
* Added ``urllib3.response.BaseHTTPResponse`` class. All future response classes will be subclasses of ``BaseHTTPResponse`` (`#2083 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2083>`__).
* Added ``FullPoolError`` which is raised when ``PoolManager(block=True)`` and a connection is returned to a full pool (`#2197 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2197>`__).
* Added ``HTTPHeaderDict`` to the top-level ``urllib3`` namespace (`#2216 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2216>`__).
* Added support for configuring header merging behavior with HTTPHeaderDict
  When using a ``HTTPHeaderDict`` to provide headers for a request, by default duplicate
  header values will be repeated. But if ``combine=True`` is passed into a call to
  ``HTTPHeaderDict.add``, then the added header value will be merged in with an existing
  value into a comma-separated list (``X-My-Header: foo, bar``) (`#2242 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2242>`__).
* Added ``NameResolutionError`` exception when a DNS error occurs (`#2305 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2305>`__).
* Added ``proxy_assert_hostname`` and ``proxy_assert_fingerprint`` kwargs to ``ProxyManager`` (`#2409 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2409>`__).
* Added a configurable ``backoff_max`` parameter to the ``Retry`` class.
  If a custom ``backoff_max`` is provided to the ``Retry`` class, it
  will replace the ``Retry.DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MAX`` (`#2494 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2494>`__).
* Added the ``authority`` property to the Url class as per RFC 3986 3.2. This property should be used in place of ``netloc`` for users who want to include the userinfo (auth) component of the URI (`#2520 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2520>`__).
* Added the ``scheme`` parameter to ``HTTPConnection.set_tunnel`` to configure the scheme of the origin being tunnelled to (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Added the ``is_closed``, ``is_connected`` and ``has_connected_to_proxy`` properties to ``HTTPConnection`` (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Added optional ``backoff_jitter`` parameter to ``Retry``. (`#2952 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2952>`__)

Changed
-------

* Changed ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.read`` to respect the semantics of ``io.BufferedIOBase`` regardless of compression. Specifically, this method:

  * Only returns an empty bytes object to indicate EOF (that is, the response has been fully consumed).
  * Never returns more bytes than requested.
  * Can issue any number of system calls: zero, one or multiple.

  If you want each ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.read`` call to issue a single system call, you need to disable decompression by setting ``decode_content=False`` (`#2128 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2128>`__).
* Changed ``urllib3.HTTPConnection.getresponse`` to return an instance of ``urllib3.HTTPResponse`` instead of ``http.client.HTTPResponse`` (`#2648 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2648>`__).
* Changed ``ssl_version`` to instead set the corresponding ``SSLContext.minimum_version``
  and ``SSLContext.maximum_version`` values.  Regardless of ``ssl_version`` passed
  ``SSLContext`` objects are now constructed using ``ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT`` (`#2110 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2110>`__).
* Changed default ``SSLContext.minimum_version`` to be ``TLSVersion.TLSv1_2`` in line with Python 3.10 (`#2373 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2373>`__).
* Changed ``ProxyError`` to wrap any connection error (timeout, TLS, DNS) that occurs when connecting to the proxy (`#2482 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2482>`__).
* Changed ``urllib3.util.create_urllib3_context`` to not override the system cipher suites with
  a default value. The new default will be cipher suites configured by the operating system (`#2168 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168>`__).
* Changed ``multipart/form-data`` header parameter formatting matches the WHATWG HTML Standard as of 2021-06-10. Control characters in filenames are no longer percent encoded (`#2257 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2257>`__).
* Changed the error raised when connecting via HTTPS when the ``ssl`` module isn't available from ``SSLError`` to ``ImportError`` (`#2589 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2589>`__).
* Changed ``HTTPConnection.request()`` to always use lowercase chunk boundaries when sending requests with ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` (`#2515 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2515>`__).
* Changed ``enforce_content_length`` default to True, preventing silent data loss when reading streamed responses (`#2514 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2514>`__).
* Changed internal implementation of ``HTTPHeaderDict`` to use ``dict`` instead of ``collections.OrderedDict`` for better performance (`#2080 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2080>`__).
* Changed the ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` module to wrap ``OpenSSL.SSL.Error`` with ``ssl.SSLError`` in ``PyOpenSSLContext.load_cert_chain`` (`#2628 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2628>`__).
* Changed usage of the deprecated ``socket.error`` to ``OSError`` (`#2120 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2120>`__).
* Changed all parameters in the ``HTTPConnection`` and ``HTTPSConnection`` constructors to be keyword-only except ``host`` and ``port`` (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Changed ``HTTPConnection.getresponse()`` to set the socket timeout from ``HTTPConnection.timeout`` value before reading
  data from the socket. This previously was done manually by the ``HTTPConnectionPool`` calling ``HTTPConnection.sock.settimeout(...)`` (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Changed the ``_proxy_host`` property to ``_tunnel_host`` in ``HTTPConnectionPool`` to more closely match how the property is used (value in ``HTTPConnection.set_tunnel()``) (`#1985 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1985>`__).
* Changed name of ``Retry.BACK0FF_MAX`` to be ``Retry.DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MAX``.
* Changed TLS handshakes to use ``SSLContext.check_hostname`` when possible (`#2452 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2452>`__).
* Changed ``server_hostname`` to behave like other parameters only used by ``HTTPSConnectionPool`` (`#2537 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2537>`__).
* Changed the default ``blocksize`` to 16KB to match OpenSSL's default read amounts (`#2348 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2348>`__).
* Changed ``HTTPResponse.read()`` to raise an error when calling with ``decode_content=False`` after using ``decode_content=True`` to prevent data loss (`#2800 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2800>`__).

Fixed
-----

* Fixed thread-safety issue where accessing a ``PoolManager`` with many distinct origins would cause connection pools to be closed while requests are in progress (`#1252 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1252>`__).
* Fixed an issue where an ``HTTPConnection`` instance would erroneously reuse the socket read timeout value from reading the previous response instead of a newly configured connect timeout.
  Instead now if ``HTTPConnection.timeout`` is updated before sending the next request the new timeout value will be used (`#2645 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2645>`__).
* Fixed ``socket.error.errno`` when raised from pyOpenSSL's ``OpenSSL.SSL.SysCallError`` (`#2118 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2118>`__).
* Fixed the default value of ``HTTPSConnection.socket_options`` to match ``HTTPConnection`` (`#2213 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2213>`__).
* Fixed a bug where ``headers`` would be modified by the ``remove_headers_on_redirect`` feature (`#2272 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2272>`__).
* Fixed a reference cycle bug in ``urllib3.util.connection.create_connection()`` (`#2277 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2277>`__).
* Fixed a socket leak if ``HTTPConnection.connect()`` fails (`#2571 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2571>`__).
* Fixed ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.WrappedSocket`` and ``urllib3.contrib.securetransport.WrappedSocket`` close methods (`#2970 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2970>`__)

1.26.16 (2023-05-23)
====================

* Fixed thread-safety issue where accessing a ``PoolManager`` with many distinct origins
  would cause connection pools to be closed while requests are in progress (`#2954 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2954>`_)

1.26.15 (2023-03-10)
====================

* Fix socket timeout value when ``HTTPConnection`` is reused (`#2645 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2645>`__)
* Remove "!" character from the unreserved characters in IPv6 Zone ID parsing
  (`#2899 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2899>`__)
* Fix IDNA handling of '\x80' byte (`#2901 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2901>`__)

1.26.14 (2023-01-11)
====================

* Fixed parsing of port 0 (zero) returning None, instead of 0. (`#2850 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2850>`__)
* Removed deprecated getheaders() calls in contrib module. Fixed the type hint of ``PoolKey.key_retries`` by adding ``bool`` to the union. (`#2865 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2865>`__)

1.26.13 (2022-11-23)
====================

* Deprecated the ``HTTPResponse.getheaders()`` and ``HTTPResponse.getheader()`` methods.
* Fixed an issue where parsing a URL with leading zeroes in the port would be rejected
  even when the port number after removing the zeroes was valid.
* Fixed a deprecation warning when using cryptography v39.0.0.
* Removed the ``<4`` in the ``Requires-Python`` packaging metadata field.

1.26.12 (2022-08-22)
====================

* Deprecated the `urllib3[secure]` extra and the `urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl` module.
  Both will be removed in v2.x. See this `GitHub issue <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2680>`_
  for justification and info on how to migrate.

1.26.11 (2022-07-25)
====================

* Fixed an issue where reading more than 2 GiB in a call to ``HTTPResponse.read`` would
  raise an ``OverflowError`` on Python 3.9 and earlier.

1.26.10 (2022-07-07)
====================

* Removed support for Python 3.5
* Fixed an issue where a ``ProxyError`` recommending configuring the proxy as HTTP
  instead of HTTPS could appear even when an HTTPS proxy wasn't configured.

1.26.9 (2022-03-16)
===================

* Changed ``urllib3[brotli]`` extra to favor installing Brotli libraries that are still
  receiving updates like ``brotli`` and ``brotlicffi`` instead of ``brotlipy``.
  This change does not impact behavior of urllib3, only which dependencies are installed.
* Fixed a socket leaking when ``HTTPSConnection.connect()`` raises an exception.
* Fixed ``server_hostname`` being forwarded from ``PoolManager`` to ``HTTPConnectionPool``
  when requesting an HTTP URL. Should only be forwarded when requesting an HTTPS URL.

1.26.8 (2022-01-07)
===================

* Added extra message to ``urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError`` when urllib3 detects that
  a proxy is configured to use HTTPS but the proxy itself appears to only use HTTP.
* Added a mention of the size of the connection pool when discarding a connection due to the pool being full.
* Added explicit support for Python 3.11.

  to better match the rest of the default parameter names. ``Retry.MAX_BACKOFF`` is removed in v2.0.
* Changed location of the vendored ``ssl.match_hostname`` function from ``urllib3.packages.ssl_match_hostname``
  to ``urllib3.util.ssl_match_hostname`` to ensure Python 3.10+ compatibility after being repackaged
  by downstream distributors.
* Fixed absolute imports, all imports are now relative.


1.26.7 (2021-09-22)
===================

* Fixed a bug with HTTPS hostname verification involving IP addresses and lack
  of SNI. (Issue #2400)
* Fixed a bug where IPv6 braces weren't stripped during certificate hostname
  matching. (Issue #2240)


1.26.6 (2021-06-25)
===================

* Deprecated the ``urllib3.contrib.ntlmpool`` module. urllib3 is not able to support
  it properly due to `reasons listed in this issue <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2282>`_.
  If you are a user of this module please leave a comment.
* Changed ``HTTPConnection.request_chunked()`` to not erroneously emit multiple
  ``Transfer-Encoding`` headers in the case that one is already specified.
* Fixed typo in deprecation message to recommend ``Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS``.


1.26.5 (2021-05-26)
===================

* Fixed deprecation warnings emitted in Python 3.10.
* Updated vendored ``six`` library to 1.16.0.
* Improved performance of URL parser when splitting
  the authority component.


1.26.4 (2021-03-15)
===================

* Changed behavior of the default ``SSLContext`` when connecting to HTTPS proxy
  during HTTPS requests. The default ``SSLContext`` now sets ``check_hostname=True``.


1.26.3 (2021-01-26)
===================

* Fixed bytes and string comparison issue with headers (Pull #2141)

* Changed ``ProxySchemeUnknown`` error message to be
  more actionable if the user supplies a proxy URL without
  a scheme. (Pull #2107)


1.26.2 (2020-11-12)
===================

* Fixed an issue where ``wrap_socket`` and ``CERT_REQUIRED`` wouldn't
  be imported properly on Python 2.7.8 and earlier (Pull #2052)


1.26.1 (2020-11-11)
===================

* Fixed an issue where two ``User-Agent`` headers would be sent if a
  ``User-Agent`` header key is passed as ``bytes`` (Pull #2047)


1.26.0 (2020-11-10)
===================

* **NOTE: urllib3 v2.0 will drop support for Python 2**.
  `Read more in the v2.0 Roadmap <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-roadmap.html>`_.

* Added support for HTTPS proxies contacting HTTPS servers (Pull #1923, Pull #1806)

* Deprecated negotiating TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 by default. Users that
  still wish to use TLS earlier than 1.2 without a deprecation warning
  should opt-in explicitly by setting ``ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1`` (Pull #2002)
  **Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Connections that receive a ``DeprecationWarning`` will fail**

* Added ``contrib`` module for using SecureTransport on macOS:
  ``urllib3.contrib.securetransport``.  (Pull #1122)

===================

* CVE-2016-9015. Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with
  PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This
  release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration
  would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting
  invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous
  flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which
  interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.

  There is no PR for this patch, as it was prepared for simultaneous disclosure
  and release. The master branch received the same fix in Pull #1010.

  contains retries history. (Issue #848)

* Timeout can no longer be set as boolean, and must be greater than zero.
  (Pull #924)

* Removed pyasn1 and ndg-httpsclient from dependencies used for PyOpenSSL. We
  now use cryptography and idna, both of which are already dependencies of
  PyOpenSSL. (Pull #930)

* Fixed infinite loop in ``stream`` when amt=None. (Issue #928)

* Try to use the operating system's certificates when we are using an
  ``SSLContext``. (Pull #941)

* Updated cipher suite list to remove 3DES-based cipher suites. (Pull #958)

* Removed the cipher suite fallback to allow HIGH ciphers. (Pull #958)

  ``urllib3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError``. (Issue #399)

* Fixed proxy-related bug where connections were being reused incorrectly.
  (Issues #366, #369)

* Added ``socket_options`` keyword parameter which allows to define
  ``setsockopt`` configuration of new sockets. (Issue #397)

* Removed ``HTTPConnection.tcp_nodelay`` in favor of
  ``HTTPConnection.default_socket_options``. (Issue #397)

* Fixed ``TypeError`` bug in Python 2.6.4. (Issue #411)


1.8.2 (2014-04-17)
==================

* Fix ``urllib3.util`` not being included in the package.


1.8.1 (2014-04-17)
==================

* Fix AppEngine bug of HTTPS requests going out as HTTP. (Issue #356)

* Don't install ``dummyserver`` into ``site-packages`` as it's only needed
  for the test suite. (Issue #362)

* Added support for specifying ``source_address``. (Issue #352)


1.8 (2014-03-04)
================

  username, and blank ports like 'hostname:').

* New ``urllib3.connection`` module which contains all the HTTPConnection
  objects.

* Several ``urllib3.util.Timeout``-related fixes. Also changed constructor
  signature to a more sensible order. [Backwards incompatible]
  (Issues #252, #262, #263)

* Use ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` if it's installed. (Issue #274)

* Added ``.tell()`` method to ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` which
  returns the number of bytes read so far. (Issue #277)

* Support for platforms without threading. (Issue #289)

* Expand default-port comparison in ``HTTPConnectionPool.is_same_host``
  to allow a pool with no specified port to be considered equal to to an
  HTTP/HTTPS url with port 80/443 explicitly provided. (Issue #305)

* Improved default SSL/TLS settings to avoid vulnerabilities.
  (Issue #309)

* Fixed ``urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager`` not retrying on connect errors.
  (Issue #310)

* Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests
  will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of
  the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)

* Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl``
  from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)

* Headers are now passed and stored as a custom
  ``urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict`` object rather than a plain ``dict``.
  (Issue #329, #333)

* Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)

* ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` now uses the operating system's default CA
  certificates on inject. (Issue #332)

* Requests with ``retries=False`` will immediately raise any exceptions without
  wrapping them in ``MaxRetryError``. (Issue #348)

  (Issue #231)

* Fixed Python 3.4 support. (Issue #238)


1.7 (2013-08-14)
================

* More exceptions are now pickle-able, with tests. (Issue #174)

* Fixed redirecting with relative URLs in Location header. (Issue #178)

* Support for relative urls in ``Location: ...`` header. (Issue #179)

* ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse`` now inherits from ``io.IOBase`` for bonus
  file-like functionality. (Issue #187)

* Passing ``assert_hostname=False`` when creating a HTTPSConnectionPool will
  skip hostname verification for SSL connections. (Issue #194)

* New method ``urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.stream(...)`` which acts as a
  generator wrapped around ``.read(...)``. (Issue #198)

* IPv6 url parsing enforces brackets around the hostname. (Issue #199)

* Fixed thread race condition in
  ``urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager.connection_from_host(...)`` (Issue #204)

* ``ProxyManager`` requests now include non-default port in ``Host: ...``
  header. (Issue #217)

* Added HTTPS proxy support in ``ProxyManager``. (Issue #170 #139)

* New ``RequestField`` object can be passed to the ``fields=...`` param which
  can specify headers. (Issue #220)

* Raise ``urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError`` when connecting to proxy fails.
  (Issue #221)

* Use international headers when posting file names. (Issue #119)

* Improved IPv6 support. (Issue #203)


1.6 (2013-04-25)
================

* Contrib: Optional SNI support for Py2 using PyOpenSSL. (Issue #156)

* ``ProxyManager`` automatically adds ``Host: ...`` header if not given.

* Improved SSL-related code. ``cert_req`` now optionally takes a string like
  "REQUIRED" or "NONE". Same with ``ssl_version`` takes strings like "SSLv23"
  The string values reflect the suffix of the respective constant variable.
  (Issue #130)

* Vendored ``socksipy`` now based on Anorov's fork which handles unexpectedly
  closed proxy connections and larger read buffers. (Issue #135)

* Ensure the connection is closed if no data is received, fixes connection leak
  on some platforms. (Issue #133)

* Added SNI support for SSL/TLS connections on Py32+. (Issue #89)

* Tests fixed to be compatible with Py26 again. (Issue #125)

* Added ability to choose SSL version by passing an ``ssl.PROTOCOL_*`` constant
  to the ``ssl_version`` parameter of ``HTTPSConnectionPool``. (Issue #109)

* Allow an explicit content type to be specified when encoding file fields.
  (Issue #126)

* Exceptions are now pickleable, with tests. (Issue #101)

* Fixed default headers not getting passed in some cases. (Issue #99)

* Treat "content-encoding" header value as case-insensitive, per RFC 2616
  Section 3.5. (Issue #110)

* "Connection Refused" SocketErrors will get retried rather than raised.
  (Issue #92)

* Updated vendored ``six``, no longer overrides the global ``six`` module
  namespace. (Issue #113)

* ``urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`` contains a ``reason`` property holding
  the exception that prompted the final retry. If ``reason is None`` then it
  was due to a redirect. (Issue #92, #114)

* Fixed ``PoolManager.urlopen()`` from not redirecting more than once.
  (Issue #149)

* Don't assume ``Content-Type: text/plain`` for multi-part encoding parameters
  that are not files. (Issue #111)

* Pass `strict` param down to ``httplib.HTTPConnection``. (Issue #122)

* Added mechanism to verify SSL certificates by fingerprint (md5, sha1) or
  against an arbitrary hostname (when connecting by IP or for misconfigured
  servers). (Issue #140)

* Streaming decompression support. (Issue #159)


1.5 (2012-08-02)
================

* Added ``urllib3.add_stderr_logger()`` for quickly enabling STDERR debug
  logging in urllib3.

* Native full URL parsing (including auth, path, query, fragment) available in
  ``urllib3.util.parse_url(url)``.

* Built-in redirect will switch method to 'GET' if status code is 303.
  (Issue #11)

* ``urllib3.PoolManager`` strips the scheme and host before sending the request
  uri. (Issue #8)

* New ``urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`` exception for when automatic decoding,
  based on the Content-Type header, fails.

* Fixed bug with pool depletion and leaking connections (Issue #76). Added
  explicit connection closing on pool eviction. Added
  ``urllib3.PoolManager.clear()``.

* 99% -> 100% unit test coverage.


1.4 (2012-06-16)
================

* Minor AppEngine-related fixes.

* Switched from ``mimetools.choose_boundary`` to ``uuid.uuid4()``.

* IPv6 url support. (Issue #72)


1.3 (2012-03-25)
================

* Removed pre-1.0 deprecated API.

* Refactored helpers into a ``urllib3.util`` submodule.

* Fixed multipart encoding to support list-of-tuples for keys with multiple
  values. (Issue #48)

* Fixed multiple Set-Cookie headers in response not getting merged properly in
  Python 3. (Issue #53)

* Minor ``encode_multipart_formdata`` fixes related to Python 3 strings vs
  bytes.


1.2.2 (2012-02-06)
==================

* Fixed packaging bug of not shipping ``test-requirements.txt``. (Issue #47)


1.2.1 (2012-02-05)
==================

* Fixed another bug related to when ``ssl`` module is not available. (Issue #41)

* Location parsing errors now raise ``urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError``
  which inherits from ``ValueError``.


1.2 (2012-01-29)
================

* Added Python 3 support (tested on 3.2.2)

* Dropped Python 2.5 support (tested on 2.6.7, 2.7.2)

* Use ``select.poll`` instead of ``select.select`` for platforms that support
  it.

* Use ``Queue.LifoQueue`` instead of ``Queue.Queue`` for more aggressive
  connection reusing. Configurable by overriding ``ConnectionPool.QueueCls``.

* Fixed ``ImportError`` during install when ``ssl`` module is not available.
  (Issue #41)

* Fixed ``PoolManager`` redirects between schemes (such as HTTP -> HTTPS) not
  completing properly. (Issue #28, uncovered by Issue #10 in v1.1)

* Ported ``dummyserver`` to use ``tornado`` instead of ``webob`` +
  ``eventlet``. Removed extraneous unsupported dummyserver testing backends.
  Added socket-level tests.

* More tests. Achievement Unlocked: 99% Coverage.


1.1 (2012-01-07)
================

* Refactored ``dummyserver`` to its own root namespace module (used for
  testing).

* Added hostname verification for ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` by vendoring in
  Py32's ``ssl_match_hostname``. (Issue #25)

* Fixed cross-host HTTP redirects when using ``PoolManager``. (Issue #10)

* Fixed ``decode_content`` being ignored when set through ``urlopen``. (Issue
  #27)

* Fixed timeout-related bugs. (Issues #17, #23)


1.0.2 (2011-11-04)
==================

* Fixed typo in ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` which would only present as a bug if
  you're using the object manually. (Thanks pyos)

* Made RecentlyUsedContainer (and consequently PoolManager) more thread-safe by
  wrapping the access log in a mutex. (Thanks @christer)

* Made RecentlyUsedContainer more dict-like (corrected ``__delitem__`` and
  ``__getitem__`` behaviour), with tests. Shouldn't affect core urllib3 code.


1.0.1 (2011-10-10)
==================

* Fixed a bug where the same connection would get returned into the pool twice,
  causing extraneous "HttpConnectionPool is full" log warnings.


1.0 (2011-10-08)
================

* Added ``PoolManager`` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and
  documented).
* Added ``ProxyManager`` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works
  with HTTPS proxies).
* Added optional partial-read support for responses when
  ``preload_content=False``. You can now make requests and just read the headers
  without loading the content.
* Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).
* Added optional explicit boundary string for ``encode_multipart_formdata``.
* Convenience request methods are now inherited from ``RequestMethods``. Old
  helpers like ``get_url`` and ``post_url`` should be abandoned in favour of
  the new ``request(method, url, ...)``.
* Refactored code to be even more decoupled, reusable, and extendable.
* License header added to ``.py`` files.
* Embiggened the documentation: Lots of Sphinx-friendly docstrings in the code
  and docs in ``docs/`` and on https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/.
* Embettered all the things!
* Started writing this file.

0.3 (2009-12-10)
================

* Added HTTPS support.
* Minor bug fixes.
* Refactored, broken backwards compatibility with 0.2.
* API to be treated as stable from this version forward.
