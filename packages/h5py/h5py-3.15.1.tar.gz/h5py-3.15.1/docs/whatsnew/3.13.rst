What's new in h5py 3.13
=======================

New features
------------

* New :meth:`.File.in_memory` constructor to conveniently build an HDF5 file
  structure in memory (:pr:`2517`).
* :class:`.Dataset` views returned by :meth:`~.Dataset.astype`,
  :meth:`~.Dataset.asstr` and :meth:`~.Dataset.fields` have gained the
  ``.dtype``, ``.ndim``, ``.shape``, and ``.size`` attributes (:pr:`2550`).
* The bundled HDF5 library in the pre-built packages was updated to 1.14.6
  (:pr:`2554`).
* Opening an existing dataset in a file is faster since it now only loads the
  "dataset creation property list" when required (:pr:`2552`).


Exposing HDF5 functions
-----------------------

* ``H5Sselect_shape_same`` exposed as :meth:`h5py.h5s.SpaceID.select_shape_same`
  (:pr:`2529`).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix various bugs when applying ``np.array`` or ``np.asarray`` to a
  :class:`.Dataset` view returned by :meth:`~.Dataset.astype`,
  :meth:`~.Dataset.asstr`, or :meth:`~.Dataset.fields`.

Building h5py
-------------

* Fixed building h5py with Numpy 2.3 (:pr:`2556`).
* Bump the specified mpi4py version to fix building with MPI support on
  Python 3.13 (:pr:`2524`).
* Fix for running ``api_gen.py`` directly (:pr:`2534`).
