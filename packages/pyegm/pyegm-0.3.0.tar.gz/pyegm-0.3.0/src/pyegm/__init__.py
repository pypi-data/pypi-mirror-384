"""
PyEGM package

Physics-inspired exemplar growth classifier that combines a prototype channel
and shell-based arrival centers. The public API re-exports the estimator and
its configuration dataclass.

Main entry points

- PyEGM:            estimator with sklearn-like interface (fit/partial_fit/predict/score)
- ExplosionConfig:  configuration dataclass for the model
