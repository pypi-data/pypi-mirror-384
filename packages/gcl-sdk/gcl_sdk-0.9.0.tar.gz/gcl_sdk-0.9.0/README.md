Contributing to the project is highly appreciated! However, some rules should be followed for successful inclusion of new changes in the project:
- All changes should be done in a separate branch.
- Changes should include not only new functionality or bug fixes, but also tests for the new code.
- After the changes are completed and **tested**, a Pull Request should be created with a clear description of the new functionality. And add one of the project maintainers as a reviewer.
- Changes can be merged only after receiving an approve from one of the project maintainers.
