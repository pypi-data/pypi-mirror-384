## Running the example

To run this example, you need to add API keys to your environment:

```shell
export PATRONUS_API_KEY=your-api-key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Running with `uv`

You can run the example as a one-liner with zero setup:

```shell
# Remember to export environment variables before running the example.
uv run --no-cache --with "patronus-examples[crewai]" \
    -m patronus_examples.tracking.crewai_weather
```

### Running the script directly

If you've cloned the repository, you can run the script directly:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/patronus-ai/patronus-py.git
cd patronus-py

# Run the example script (requires uv)
./examples/patronus_examples/tracking/crewai_weather.py
```

### Manual installation

If you prefer to copy the example code to your own project, you'll need to install these dependencies:

```shell
pip install patronus
pip install crewai
pip install openinference.instrumentation.crewai
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-threading
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncio
```

## Example overview

This example demonstrates how to use Patronus to trace and monitor CrewAI agents in a weather application. The example:

1. Sets up a specialized Weather Information Specialist agent with a custom weather tool
2. Creates a manager agent that coordinates information requests
3. Defines tasks for each agent to perform
4. Configures a hierarchical workflow using the CrewAI Crew construct
5. Traces the entire execution flow with Patronus

The example shows how Patronus integrates with CrewAI to provide visibility into agent interactions, tool usage, and the hierarchical task execution process.
