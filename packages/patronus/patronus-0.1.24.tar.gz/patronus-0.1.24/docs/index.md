# Patronus Python SDK Documentation

The Patronus SDK provides tools for observability, evaluation, and experimentation with Large Language Models (LLMs),
helping you build reliable and high-quality AI applications.

> This documentation covers only the Python SDK.
> For comprehensive documentation on the Patronus platform, evaluators, and best practices,
> please visit the [official Patronus documentation](https://docs.patronus.ai).

## llms.txt

The Patronus Python SDK documentation is available in the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) format.
This format is defined in Markdown and suited for large language models.

Two formats are available:

- [llms.txt](https://patronus-ai.github.io/patronus-py/llms.txt): a file containing a brief description of the SDK, along with links to the different sections of the documentation. The structure of this file is described in detail [here](https://llmstxt.org/#format).
- [llms-full.txt](https://patronus-ai.github.io/patronus-py/llms-full.txt): Similar to the `llms.txt` file, but every link content is included. Note that this file may be too large for some LLMs.
