# Roadmap

Don't worry, the feature set will grow ...

## Features


- [ ] the `csv//` directive might be improved with specification of the 
  number of rows that a header takes up, that might need to go into a field, 
  e.g. `args` below and at the same level as where the directive is.

- [ ] Add pluggable functionality to NavDict to do something like 
`bad_pixels//<filename>.fits` and this will then execute a function that 
  takes the `<filename>.fits` as an argument. That function can return a 
  filename or a file descriptor, or a FITS object....
