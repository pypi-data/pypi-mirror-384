Python version: <span style="color: aqua;">__>= 3.11__</span>
#### The library is very limited in functions compared to [redis-py](https://github.com/redis/redis-py), but has a wide functionality if you need a minimal set of commands to work with the database.
## <span style="color: white;">Install</span>

`pip install pyluaredis`</br></br>

### <span style="color: white;">How does this library differ from [redis-py](https://github.com/redis/redis-py), on which it is built?</span>

__For quick connection to your Python projects and easy usage.__ <span style="color: violet;">__«Plug and Play»__ :)</span></br>

1. The methods have a more flexible type system, you can get both a number and a list using one r_get function, without worrying about what exactly is being treated in a given key.
2. Scenarios that require 2 or more calls to the Redis service are built on the basis of Lua scripts that perform all operations in 1 call to the server.
3. The methods have additional parameters that are not in the standard library, for example, an analogue of RETURNING (like in Postgres), which also allows you not to worry about the type of the variable that lies in a given key.
4. It helps in the development of applications following the [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) principles.
* It is assumed that you already have the <span style="color: red;">__Redis__</span> service installed and running.
* There is no need to install <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">__Lua__</span> as it is built into <span style="color: red;">__Redis__</span>.

### _________________________________________________________________________
### Is it slower than the original implementation? Yes, it is slower.
But, .lua scripts are cached within a single class object and subsequent function calls will be faster (almost the same time as the original implementation).

You can see comparisons with the original library in the file **benchmark/main.py**
This library is not about the speed of working with Redis, it is about the ease of working with Redis, allowing you to not worry about a lot of different functions of the database and the original library, as well as data types.

<span style="color: aqua;">**Supported Python types:**</span>
* integer
* float
* string
* boolean
* bytes
* list
* tuple
* set
* frozenset

The number of supported methods and data types increases as the project develops, <span style="color: aqua;">**but it has all the basic methods for working with Redis**</span> (see the list and description of current commands with examples in the `example.py` file in the root of the repository).

<span style="color: white;"><u>Backward compatibility of functions is also preserved, which allows you to avoid problems when 
using the library in your projects</u></span>
