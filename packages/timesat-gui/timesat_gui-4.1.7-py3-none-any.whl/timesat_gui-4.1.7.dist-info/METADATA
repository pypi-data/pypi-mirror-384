# TIMESAT GUI

`TIMESAT GUI` is a graphical user interface and workflow manager for the [TIMESAT](https://pypi.org/project/timesat/) package.  
It provides a simple web dashboard to configure and run TIMESAT.

---

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** (for environment management)  
  Download: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Internet access** (for package installation and updates)
- Optional: a modern web browser to access the interface.

---

## Installation

`timesat-gui` is available on **TestPyPI** and can be installed using **pip** or **uv**.  
Although it is not published on Conda, you can safely install it *inside* a Conda environment.

### Option 1 — Install inside a Conda environment

```bash
conda create -n timesat python=3.12
conda activate timesat
pip install timesat-gui
```

> This approach uses Conda only for environment isolation.  
> The installation itself is handled by pip, which will automatically install `timesat` and all required dependencies.

---

### Option 2 — Install via uv (recommended for pure Python environments)

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern, high-performance alternative to pip and venv.

1. Install `uv`:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   # or
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the package:

   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install timesat-gui
   ```

> `uv` provides faster dependency resolution and caching.  
> It will automatically install `timesat` and related dependencies.

---

### Option 3 — Direct installation with pip

If you already have Python 3.12+ installed:

```bash
pip install timesat-gui
```

---

## Launch the Application

After installation, start the GUI with:

```bash
timesat-gui
```
