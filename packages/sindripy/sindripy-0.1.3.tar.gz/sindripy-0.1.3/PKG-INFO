Sindri replaces ad hoc primitives and fragile validators with a consistent Value Object and Aggregate 
toolkit you can adopt quickly. 
Spin up validated value objects, aggregates, and test data with a simple and a small, focused API.

Sindripy provides a basic-high-customizable implementation to help you enforce
domain invariants and improve code quality with minimal effort.

<br>

<b>Why use sindripy?</b> Building your domain with Sindri lets you:

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
  <li>⏱️ Cut domain modeling and validation to seconds</li>
  <li>🛡️ Declare immutable, validated value objects with clear error messages</li>
  <li>🧩 Model aggregates with explicit invariants and composition</li>
  <li>🧪 Generate realistic test data via the Object Mother pattern</li>
  <li>🧰 Start from ready made primitives and identifiers or extend with your own</li>
  <li>🔧 Plug in custom validators, decorators, and typed primitives</li>
</ul>

## Installation

The latest version of `sindripy` can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install sindripy
```

### Requirements

Sindri tries to support the latest Python versions, we officially support from Python 3.10 to 3.13.
Older versions of Python may work, but they are not guaranteed to be compatible.

## Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use `sindri` to create a value object and generate test data using an object mother.

```python
from sindripy.value_objects import Integer, String

age = Integer(30)
name = String("John Doe")

print(f"Name: {name.value}, Age: {age.value}")
```

```python
from sindripy.mothers import IntegerPrimitivesMother, StringPrimitivesMother

random_age = IntegerPrimitivesMother.any()
random_name = StringPrimitivesMother.any()
```

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about advanced usage of value objects, including validation, custom value objects,
> complex objects like aggregates, visit the [Value Objects](https://dimanu-py.github.io/sindri/value_objects/)
> and [Object Mothers](https://dimanu-py.github.io/sindri/object_mothers) sections.
