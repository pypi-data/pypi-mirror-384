test, chore), followed by an optional scope in parentheses, a colon, and then a
short description in the present tense. Do not include any other text, explanation,
or markdown formatting.

- Large, duplicated code blocks.

If you find a critical issue, respond with "VETO:" followed by a brief, one-sentence
explanation of the most critical issue.
If the code looks acceptable for a commit, respond with "OK".

Do not provide any other preamble or explanation. Your response must start with
either "VETO:" or "OK".
