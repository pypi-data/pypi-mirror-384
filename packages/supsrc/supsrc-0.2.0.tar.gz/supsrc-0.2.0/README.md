**Never forget to commit again!** `supsrc` watches your specified repositories for changes and automatically stages, commits, and (optionally) pushes them according to rules you define. Perfect for frequent checkpointing, synchronizing work-in-progress, or ensuring volatile experiments are saved.

</div>

## ü§î Why `supsrc`?

*   **Automated Checkpoints:** Working on something complex or experimental? `supsrc` can automatically commit your changes after a period of inactivity or after a certain number of saves, creating a safety net without interrupting your flow.
*   **Effortless Syncing:** Keep a work-in-progress branch automatically pushed to a remote for backup or collaboration, without manual `git add/commit/push` steps.
*   **Simple Configuration:** Define your repositories and rules in a clear TOML file.
*   **Focused:** Designed specifically for the "watch and sync" workflow, aiming to be simpler than custom scripting or more complex backup solutions for this specific task.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üìÇ Directory Monitoring:** Watches specified repository directories recursively for file changes using `watchdog`.
*   **üìú Rule-Based Triggers:**
    *   **Inactivity:** Trigger actions after a configurable period of no file changes (e.g., `30s`, `5m`).
    *   **Save Count:** Trigger actions after a specific number of file save events.
    *   **Manual:** Disable automatic triggers (useful for testing or specific setups).
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Git Engine:**
    *   Interacts with Git repositories using `pygit2`.
    *   Automatically stages modified, added, and deleted files (respecting `.gitignore`).
    *   Performs commits with customizable message templates (including timestamps, save counts, and change summaries).
    *   Optionally pushes changes to a configured remote and branch.
    *   Handles SSH Agent authentication and basic HTTPS (user/token via env vars).
*   **üìù TOML Configuration:** Easy-to-understand configuration file (`supsrc.conf`).
*   **üï∂Ô∏è `.gitignore` Respect:** Automatically ignores files specified in the repository's `.gitignore`.
*   **üìä Structured Logging:** Detailed logging using `structlog` for observability (JSON or colored console output).
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Optional TUI:** An interactive Terminal User Interface (built with `textual`) for monitoring repository status and logs in real-time.
*   **üìü Tail Mode:** A headless, non-interactive mode for monitoring repositories without terminal control issues (useful for scripts and automation).

## üöÄ Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package installer and resolver:

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install supsrc
uv pip install supsrc

# Install with TUI support
uv pip install 'supsrc[tui]'

# Install with LLM support (Gemini and Ollama)
uv pip install 'supsrc[llm]'

# Install with all optional features
uv pip install 'supsrc[tui,llm]'
```

### Using pip

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed:

```bash
pip install supsrc

# With TUI support
pip install 'supsrc[tui]'

# With LLM support
pip install 'supsrc[llm]'
```

## üí° Usage

1.  **Create a Configuration File:** By default, `supsrc` looks for `supsrc.conf` in the current directory. See the [Configuration](#-configuration) section below for details.

2.  **Run the Watcher:**

    ```bash
    # Run with interactive dashboard (TUI mode)
    supsrc sui

    # Run in headless mode (non-interactive)
    supsrc watch

    # Specify a different config file
    supsrc sui -c /path/to/your/config.toml
    supsrc watch -c /path/to/your/config.toml

    # Increase log verbosity
    supsrc watch --log-level DEBUG
    ```

3.  **Check Configuration:** Validate and display the loaded configuration (including environment variable overrides):

    ```bash
    supsrc config show
    supsrc config show -c path/to/config.toml
    ```

4.  **Stop the Watcher:** Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the watcher gracefully.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`supsrc.conf`)

Create a file named `supsrc.conf` (or specify another path using `-c`). Here's an example:

```toml
# Example supsrc.conf

# Global settings (can be overridden by environment variables like SUPSRC_LOG_LEVEL)
[global]
log_level = "INFO" # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

# Define repositories to monitor
[repositories]

  # Unique identifier for this repository monitoring task
  [repositories.my-project]
    # Path to the Git repository (use '~' for home directory)
    path = "~/dev/my-project"
    # Set to false to temporarily disable monitoring for this repo
    enabled = true

    # Define the rule that triggers actions
    [repositories.my-project.rule]
      # Trigger after 5 minutes of inactivity
      type = "supsrc.rules.inactivity" # Built-in rule type
      period = "5m" # Format: XhYmZs (e.g., "30s", "10m", "1h5m")

      # --- OR ---
      # Trigger after every 10 save events
      # type = "supsrc.rules.save_count"
      # count = 10

      # --- OR ---
      # Disable automatic triggers (requires external mechanism if actions are needed)
      # type = "supsrc.rules.manual"

    # Configure the repository engine (currently only Git)
    [repositories.my-project.repository]
      type = "supsrc.engines.git" # Must be specified

      # --- Git Engine Specific Options ---
      # Automatically push after successful commit? (Default: false)
      auto_push = true
      # Remote to push to (Default: 'origin')
      remote = "origin"
      # Branch to push (Default: uses the current checked-out branch)
      # branch = "main"
      # Commit message template (Go template syntax)
      # Available placeholders: {{timestamp}}, {{repo_id}}, {{save_count}}, {{change_summary}}
      commit_message_template = "feat: Auto-sync changes at {{timestamp}}\n\n{{change_summary}}"

  [repositories.another-repo]
    path = "/path/to/another/repo"
    enabled = true
    [repositories.another-repo.rule]
      type = "supsrc.rules.inactivity"
      period = "30s"
    [repositories.another-repo.repository]
      type = "supsrc.engines.git"
      auto_push = false # Keep commits local for this one
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

*   `SUPSRC_CONF`: Path to the configuration file.
*   `SUPSRC_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
*   `SUPSRC_LOG_FILE`: Path to write JSON logs to a file.
*   `SUPSRC_JSON_LOGS`: Set to `true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on` to output console logs as JSON.

## üß† LLM Configuration (Optional)

`supsrc` can use Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate tasks like generating commit messages, reviewing changes for obvious errors, and analyzing test failures. This requires the `supsrc[llm]` extra to be installed.

To enable LLM features for a specific repository, add an `[repositories.<repo_id>.llm]` section to your `supsrc.conf`.

```toml
# In your supsrc.conf file...

[repositories.my-llm-project]
  path = "~/dev/my-llm-project"
  enabled = true
  [repositories.my-llm-project.rule]
    type = "supsrc.rules.inactivity"
    period = "2m"
  [repositories.my-llm-project.repository]
    type = "supsrc.engines.git"
    auto_push = true

  # --- LLM Configuration Section ---
  [repositories.my-llm-project.llm]
    # Enable LLM features for this repo
    enabled = true

    # --- Provider Setup ---
    # Choose your LLM provider: "gemini" or "ollama"
    provider = "gemini"
    # Specify the model to use
    model = "gemini-1.5-flash" # For Gemini
    # model = "llama3" # Example for Ollama

    # (For Gemini) Specify the environment variable containing your API key
    api_key_env_var = "GEMINI_API_KEY"

    # --- Feature Flags ---
    # Automatically generate the commit message subject line
    generate_commit_message = true
    # Use Conventional Commits format for the generated message
    use_conventional_commit = true
    # Perform a quick review of changes and veto the commit on critical issues (e.g., secrets)
    review_changes = true
    # Run a test command before committing
    run_tests = true
    # If tests fail, use the LLM to analyze the failure output
    analyze_test_failures = true

    # --- Additional Settings ---
    # Specify the command to run for tests. If not set, supsrc tries to infer it.
    test_command = "pytest"
```

### Provider Details

*   **Gemini (`provider = "gemini"`)**
    *   Uses the Google Gemini API.
    *   Requires an API key. By default, it looks for the key in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can change the variable name with `api_key_env_var`.
    *   **Setup:**
        1.  Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
        2.  Set the environment variable: `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"`

*   **Ollama (`provider = "ollama"`)**
    *   Connects to a local [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) instance.
    *   Does not require an API key.
    *   **Setup:**
        1.  Install and run Ollama on your machine.
        2.  Pull a model you want to use, e.g., `ollama pull llama3`.
        3.  Set `provider = "ollama"` and `model = "llama3"` (or your chosen model) in the config.

## Î£∞ Rules Explained

The `[repositories.*.rule]` section defines when `supsrc` should trigger its actions (stage, commit, push).

*   **`type = "supsrc.rules.inactivity"`**
    *   Triggers when no filesystem changes have been detected in the repository for the duration specified by `period`.
    *   `period`: A string defining the inactivity duration (e.g., `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h"`).
*   **`type = "supsrc.rules.save_count"`**
    *   Triggers when the number of detected save events reaches the specified `count`. The count resets after a successful action sequence.
    *   `count`: A positive integer (e.g., `10`).
*   **`type = "supsrc.rules.manual"`**
    *   Disables automatic triggering by `supsrc`. Actions would need to be initiated externally if this rule is used (primarily for testing or advanced scenarios).

## üî© Engines

`supsrc` uses engines to interact with different types of repositories.

*   **`type = "supsrc.engines.git"`**
    *   The primary engine for interacting with Git repositories.
    *   Uses the `pygit2` library.
    *   Supports status checks, staging (respecting `.gitignore`), committing, and pushing.

### Git Engine Authentication

The Git engine currently supports:

1.  **SSH Agent:** If your remote URL is SSH-based (e.g., `git@github.com:...`), `supsrc` will attempt to use `pygit2.KeypairFromAgent` to authenticate via a running SSH agent. Ensure your agent is running and the correct key is loaded.
2.  **HTTPS (Environment Variables):** For HTTPS URLs (e.g., `https://github.com/...`), `supsrc` will look for the following environment variables:
    *   `GIT_USERNAME`: Your Git username.
    *   `GIT_PASSWORD`: Your Git password **or preferably a Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

*Note: Storing credentials directly is generally discouraged. Using an SSH agent or short-lived tokens is recommended.*

## üñ•Ô∏è Textual TUI (Optional)

If installed (`pip install 'supsrc[tui]'`) and run with `supsrc watch`, a terminal user interface provides:

*   A live-updating table showing the status, last change time, save count, and errors for each monitored repository.
*   A scrolling log view displaying messages from `supsrc`.
