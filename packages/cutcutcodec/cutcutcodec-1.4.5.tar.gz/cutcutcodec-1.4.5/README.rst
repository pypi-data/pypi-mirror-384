Description
===========

This **video editing software** has been designed for speed and to implement some effects that are hard to find elsewhere.
The kernel is written in python and C, so it's easy to integrate it in your own project.
Although it allows you to fine-tune many parameters, it's smart enough to find the settings that are best suited to your project.

This software is **fast** and **highly configurable** for the following reasons:

#. Based on `PyAV <https://pyav.org>`_, this software supports an incredible number of formats and codecs.
#. A complete test benchmark guarantees an excelent kernel reliability.
#. Powered by `torch <https://pytorch.org>`_ and written in C, this software efficiently exploits the CPU and GPU in order to make it very fast.
#. The code is parallelised to take advantage of all the CPU threads, making it extremely fast.


Examples
========

There are plenty of `other examples in the documentation <https://cutcutcodec.readthedocs.io/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html>`_!

In the following stupid example, we blink the blue color and we add a red noise on the bottom.

.. code-block:: python

    import cutcutcodec

    SETTINGS = [
        {"encodec": "libsvtav1", "rate": 30, "shape": (480, 720)},
        {"encodec": "libvorbis", "rate": 44100, "bitrate": 128000},  # optional bitrate
    ]

    with cutcutcodec.read("media/video/intro.webm") as container:
        video, audio = container.out_select("video")[0], container.out_select("audio")[0]
        noise = cutcutcodec.generation.video.GeneratorVideoNoise().out_streams[0]
        video = cutcutcodec.filter.video.equation.FilterVideoEquation(
            [video, noise], "r0/2 + r1*(i+1)/2", "g0", "b0*sin(2*pi*0.5*t)"
        ).out_streams[0]
        cutcutcodec.write([video, audio], "/tmp/my_video.webm", streams_settings=SETTINGS)
