class Schema(Endpoint):
    """
    An endpoint that automatically creates a swagger doc for the application.

    The schema endpoint must always be attached to an endpoint group.  It will document all endpoints
    attached to its parent endpoint group.

    Keep in mind that the routing in the endpoint group is greedy and goes from top-down.  As a result,
    since the schema endpoint (typically) has a specific URL, it's usually best for it to be at the top
    of your endpoint list.  The following example builds an application with two endpoint groups, each
    of which has a schema endpoint:

    ```
    import clearskies
    from clearskies.validators import Required, Unique

        thing_1 = clearskies.columns.String(validators=[Required()])
        thing_2 = clearskies.columns.String(validators=[Unique()])


    more_endpoints = clearskies.EndpointGroup(

            clearskies.endpoints.HealthCheck(url="health"),
            clearskies.endpoints.Schema(url="schema"),

    ```

    We attach the `more_endpoints` endpoint group to our context, and this contains 4 endpoints:

     1. A healthcheck
     2. A schema endpoint
     3. A callable endpoint
     4. The `users_api` endpoint group.

    The `users_api` endpoint group then contains it's own schema endpoint and a restful api endpoint
    with all our standard user CRUD operations.  As a result, we can fetch two different schema endpoints:

    ```
    curl 'http://localhost/schema'

    curl 'http://localhost/users/schema'
    ```

    The former documents all endpoints in the system.  The latter only documents the endpoints under the `/users`
    path provided by the `users_api` endpoint group.
