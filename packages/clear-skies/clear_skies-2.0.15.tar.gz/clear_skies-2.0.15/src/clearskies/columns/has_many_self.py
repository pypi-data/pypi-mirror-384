    This is just like the HasMany column, but is used when the model references itself.

    This exists because a model can't refer to itself inside it's own class definition.  There are
    workarounds, but having this class is usually quicker for the developer.

    The main difference between this and HasMany is that you don't have to provide the child class.
    Also, the name of the column that contains the id of the parent becomes `parent_id` by default,
    rather than basing it on the name of the model.  This is done because, since the model is also
    the child, using the name of the model in the name of the column id is often ambiguous.

        This is an external trigger called by the model class when the model class is ready.
        The reason it exists here instead of in the constructor is because some columns are tightly
        connected to the model class, and can't validate configuration until they know what the model is.
