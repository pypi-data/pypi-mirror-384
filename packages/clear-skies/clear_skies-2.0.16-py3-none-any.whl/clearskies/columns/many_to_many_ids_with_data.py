    A column to represent a many-to-many relationship with information stored in the relationship itself.

    This is an extention of the many-to-many column, but with one important addition: data about the
    relationship is stored in the pivot table.  This creates some differences, which are best
    explained by example:

    ```python

        backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

        id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
        # these could also be belongs to relationships, but the pivot model
        # is rarely used directly, so I'm being lazy to avoid having to use
        # model references.

                ],
            }
        )

        return widget

        clearskies.endpoints.Callable(
            my_application,
            model_class=Widget,
            return_records=True,

    As with setting ids in the ManyToManyIds class, any items left out will result in the relationship
    (including all its related data) being removed.  An important difference with the ManyToManyWithData
    column is the way you specify which record is being connected.  This is easy for the ManyToManyIds column
    because all you provide is the id from the related model.  When working with the ManyToManyWithData
    column, you provide a dictionary for each relationship (so you can provide the data that goes in the
    pivot model).  To let it know what record is being connected, you therefore explicitly provide
    the id from the related model in a dictionary key with the name of the related model id column in
    the pivot (e.g. `{"thingy_id": id}` in the first example.  However, if there are unique columns in the
    related model, you can provide those instead.  If you execute the above example you'll get:

    ```json
    {
        "status": "success",
        "error": "",
        "data": {
            "id": "c4be91a8-85a1-4e29-994a-327f59e26ec7",
