    A clearskies model.

    To be useable, a model class needs four things:

     1. The name of the id column
     2. A backend
     3. A destination name (equivalent to a table name for SQL backends)
     4. Columns

    In more detail:

    ### Id Column Name

    clearskies assumes that all models have a column that uniquely identifies each record.  This id column is
    provided where appropriate in the lifecycle of the model save process to help connect and find related records.
    It's defined as a simple class attribute called `id_column_name`.  There **MUST** be a column with the same name
    in the column definitions.  A simple approach to take is to use the Uuid column as an id column.  This will
    automatically provide a random UUID when the record is first created.  If you are using auto-incrementing integers,
    you can simply use an `Int` column type and define the column as auto-incrementing in your database.

    ### Backend

    Every model needs a backend, which is an object that extends clearskies.Backend and is attached to the
    `backend` attribute of the model class.  clearskies comes with a variety of backends in the `clearskies.backends`
    module that you can use, and you can also define your own or import more from additional packages.

    ### Destination Name

    The destination name is the equivalent of a table name in other frameworks, but the name is more generic to
    reflect the fact that clearskies is intended to work with a variety of backends - not just SQL databases.
    The exact meaning of the destination name depends on the backend: for a cursor backend it is in fact used
    as the table name when fetching/storing records.  For the API backend it is frequently appended to a base
    URL to reach the corect endpoint.

    This is provided by a class function call `destination_name`.  The base model class declares a generic method
    for this which takes the class name, converts it from title case to snake case, and makes it plural.  Hence,
    a model class called `User` will have a default destination name of `users` and a model class of `OrderProduct`
    will have a default destination name of `order_products`.  Of course, this system isn't pefect: your backend
    may have a different convention or you may have one of the many words in the english language that are
    exceptions to the grammatical rules of making words plural.  In this case you can simply extend the method
    and change it according to your needs, e.g.:

    ```
    from typing import Self
    import clearskies


    class Fish(clearskies.Model):
        @classmethod
        def destination_name(cls: type[Self]) -> str:
            return "fish"
    ```

    ### Columns

    Finally, columns are defined by attaching attributes to your model class that extend clearskies.Column.  A variety
    are provided by default in the clearskies.columns module, and you can always create more or import them from
    other packages.

    ### Fetching From the Di Container

    In order to use a model in your application you need to retrieve it from the dependency injection system.  Like
    everything, you can do this by either the name or with type hinting.  Models do have a special rule for
    injection-via-name: like all classes their dependency injection name is made by converting the class name from
    title case to snake case, but they are also available via the pluralized name.  Here's a quick example of all
    three approaches for dependency injection:

    ```
    import clearskies


    class User(clearskies.Model):
        id_column_name = "id"
        backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

        id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
        name = clearskies.columns.String()


    def my_application(user, users, by_type_hint: User):
        return {
            "all_are_user_models": isinstance(user, User)
            and isinstance(users, User)
            and isinstance(by_type_hint, User)
        }


    cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(my_application, classes=[User])
    cli()
    ```

    Note that the `User` model class was provided in the `classes` list sent to the context: that's important as it
    informs the dependency injection system that this is a class we want to provide.  It's common (but not required)
    to put all models for a clearskies application in their own separate python module and then provide those to
    the depedency injection system via the `modules` argument to the context.  So you may have a directory structure
    like this:

    ```
    ├── app/
    │   └── models/
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       ├── category.py
    │       ├── order.py
    │       ├── product.py
    │       ├── status.py
    │       └── user.py
    └── api.py
    ```

    Where `__init__.py` imports all the models:

    ```
    from app.models.category import Category
    from app.models.order import Order
    from app.models.proudct import Product
    from app.models.status import Status
    from app.models.user import User

    __all__ = ["Category", "Order", "Product", "Status", "User"]
    ```

    Then in your main application you can just import the whole `models` module into your context:

    ```
    import app.models

    cli = clearskies.contexts.cli(SomeApplication, modules=[app.models])
    ```

    ### Adding Dependencies

    The base model class extends `clearskies.di.InjectableProperties` which means that you can inject dependencies into your model
    using the `di.inject` classes.  Here's an example that demonstrates dependency injection for models:

    ```
    import datetime
    import clearskies


    class SomeClass:
        # Since this will be built by the DI system directly, we can declare dependencies in the __init__
        def __init__(self, some_date):
            self.some_date = some_date


    class User(clearskies.Model):
        id_column_name = "id"
        backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

        utcnow = clearskies.di.inject.Utcnow()
        some_class = clearskies.di.inject.ByClass(SomeClass)

        id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
        name = clearskies.columns.String()

        def some_date_in_the_past(self):
            return self.some_class.some_date < self.utcnow


    def my_application(user):
        return user.some_date_in_the_past()


    cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(
        my_application,
        classes=[User],
        bindings={
            "some_date": datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc) - datetime.timedelta(days=1),
        },
    )
    cli()
    ```

        ### Lifecycle of a Save

        Before discussing the mechanics of how to save a model, it helps to understand the full lifecycle of a save
        operation.  Of course you can ignore this lifecycle and simply use the save process to send data to a
        backend, but then you miss out on one of the key advantages of clearskies - supporting a state machine
        flow for defining your applications.  The save process is controlled not just by the model but also by
        the columns, with equivalent hooks for both.  This creates a lot of flexibility for how to control and
        organize an application.  The overall save process looks like this:

         1. The `pre_save` hook in each column is called (including the `on_change_pre_save` actions attached to the columns)
         2. The `pre_save` hook for the model is called
         3. The `to_backend` hook for each column is called and temporary data is removed from the save dictionary
         4. The `to_backend` hook for the model is called
         5. The data is persisted to the backend via a create or update call as appropriate
         6. The `post_save` hook in each column is called (including the `on_change_post_save` actions attached to the columns)
         7. The `post_save` hook in the model is called
         8. Any data returned by the backend during the create/update operation is saved to the model along with the temporary data
         9. The `save_finished` hook in each column is called (including the `on_change_save_finished` actions attached to the columns)
         10. The `save_finished` hook in the model is called

        Note that pre/post/finished hooks for all columns are called - not just the ones with data in the save.
        Thus, any column attached to a model can always influence the save process.

        From this we can see how to use these hooks.  In particular:

         1. The `pre_save` hook is used to modify the data before it is persisted to the backend.  This means that changes
            can be made to the data dictionary in the `pre_save` step and there will still only be a single save operation
            with the backend.  For columns, the `on_change_pre_save` methods *MUST* be stateless - they can return data to
            change the save but should not make any changes themselves.  This is because they may be called more than once
            in a given save operation.
         2. `to_backend` is used to modify data on its way to the backend.  Consider dates: in python these are typically represented
            by datetime objects but, to persist this to (for instance) an SQL database, it usually has to be converted to a string
            format first.  That happens in the `to_backend` method of the datetime column.
         3. The `post_save` hook is called after the backend is updated.  Therefore, if you are using auto-incrementing ids,
            the id will only be available in ths hook.  For consistency with this, clearskies doesn't directly provide the record id
            until the `post_save` hook.  If you need to make more data changes in this hook, an additional operation will
            be required.  Since the backend has already been updated, this hook does not require a return value (and anything
            returned will be ignored).
         4. The save finished hook happens after the save is fully completed. The backend is updated and the model has been
            updated and the model state reflects the new backend state.

        The following table summarizes some key details of these hooks:

        | Name            | Stateful | Return Value   | Id Present | Backend Updated | Model Updated |
        |-----------------|----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
        | `pre_save`      | No       | dict[str, Any] | No         | No              | No            |
        | `post_save`     | Yes      | None           | Yes        | Yes             | No            |
        | `save_finished` | Yes      | None           | Yes        | Yes             | Yes           |

        ### How to Create/Update a Model

        There are two supported flows.  One is to pass in a dictionary of data to save:

        ```python
        import clearskies


        class User(clearskies.Model):
            id_column_name = "id"
            backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

            id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
            name = clearskies.columns.String()


        def my_application(user):
            user.save(
                {
                    "name": "Awesome Person",
                }
            )
            return {"id": user.id, "name": user.name}


        cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(
            my_application,
            classes=[User],
        )
        cli()
        ```

        And the other is to set new values on the columns attributes and then call save without data:

        ```python
        import clearskies


        class User(clearskies.Model):
            id_column_name = "id"
            backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

            id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
            name = clearskies.columns.String()


        def my_application(user):
            user.name = "Awesome Person"
            user.save()
            return {"id": user.id, "name": user.name}


        cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(
            my_application,
            classes=[User],
        )
        cli()
        ```

        The primray difference is that setting attributes provides strict type checking capabilities, while passing a
        dictionary can be done in one line.  Note that you cannot combine these methods: if you set a value on a
        column attribute and also pass in a dictionary of data to the save, then an exception will be raised.
        In either case the save operation acts in place  on the model object.  The return value is always True - in
        the event of an error an exception will be raised.

        If a record already exists in the model being saved, then an update operation will be executed.  Otherwise,
        a new record will be inserted.  To understand the difference yourself, you can convert a model to a boolean
        value - it will return True if a record has been loaded and false otherwise.  You can see that with this
        example, where all the `if` statements will evaluate to `True`:

        ```
        import clearskies


        class User(clearskies.Model):
            id_column_name = "id"
            backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

            id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
            name = clearskies.columns.String()


        def my_application(user):
            if not user:
                print("We will execute a create operation")

            user.save({"name": "Test One"})
            new_id = user.id

            if user:
                print("We will execute an update operation")

            user.save({"name": "Test Two"})

            final_id = user.id

            if new_id == final_id:
                print("The id did not chnage because the second save performed an update")

            return {"id": user.id, "name": user.name}


        cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(
            my_application,
            classes=[User],
        )
        cli()
        ```

        occassionaly, you may want to execute a save operation without actually providing any data.  This may happen,
        for instance, if you want to create a record in the database that will be filled in later, and so just need
        an auto-generated id.  By default if you call save without setting attributes on the model and without
        providing data to the `save` call, this will raise an exception, but you can make this happen with the
        `no_data` kwarg:

        ```
        import clearskies


        class User(clearskies.Model):
            id_column_name = "id"
            backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

            id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
            name = clearskies.columns.String()


        def my_application(user):
            # create a record with just an id
            user.save(no_data=True)

            # and now we can set the name
            user.save({"name": "Test"})

            return {"id": user.id, "name": user.name}


        cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(
            my_application,

        Note whether or not the value is changing is typically evaluated with a simple `=` comparison,
        but columns can optionally implement their own custom logic.

        Pass in the name of the column to check and the data dictionary from the save in progress.  This only
        returns meaningful results during a save, which typically happens in the pre-save/post-save hooks
        (either on the model class itself or in a column).  Here's an examle that extends the `pre_save` hook
        on the model to demonstrate how `is_changing` works:

        ```
        from typing import Any, Self
        import clearskies


        class User(clearskies.Model):
            id_column_name = "id"
            backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

            id = clearskies.columns.Uuid()
            name = clearskies.columns.String()
            age = clearskies.columns.Integer()

            def pre_save(self: Self, data: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
                if self.is_changing("name", data) and self.is_changing("age", data):
                    print("My name and age have changed!")
                elif self.is_changing("name", data):
                    print("Only my name is changing")
                elif self.is_changing("age", data):
                    print("Only my age is changing")
                else:
                    print("Nothing changed")
                return data


        def my_application(users):
            jane = users.create({"name": "Jane"})
            jane.save({"age": 22})
            jane.save({"name": "Anon", "age": 23})
            jane.save({"name": "Anon", "age": 23})

            return {"id": jane.id, "name": jane.name}


        cli = clearskies.contexts.Cli(
            my_application,
            classes=[User],
        )
        cli()
        ```

        If you run the above example it will print out:

        ```
        Only my name is changing
        Only my age is changing
        My name and age have changed
        Nothing changed
        ```

        The first message is printed out when the record is created - during a create operation, any column that
        is being set to a non-null value is considered to be changing.  We then set the age, and since it changes
        from a null value (we didn't originally set an age with the create operation, so the age was null) to a
        non-null value, `is_changed` returns True.  We perform another update operation and set both
        name and age to new values, so both change.  Finally we repeat the same save operation.  This will result
        in another update operation on the backend, but `is_changed` reflects the fact that the values haven't
        actually changed from their previous values.

        Add a hook to add additional logic in the pre-save step of the save process.

        The pre/post/finished steps of the model are directly analogous to the pre/post/finished steps for the columns.

        pre-save is inteneded to be a stateless hook (e.g. you should not make changes to the backend) where you can
        adjust the data being saved to the model.  It is called before any data is persisted to the backend and
        must return a dictionary of data that will be added to the save, potentially over-writing the save data.
        Since pre-save happens before communicating with the backend, the record itself will not yet exist in the
        event of a create operation, and so the id will not be-present for auto-incrementing ids.  As a result, the
        record id is not provided during the pre-save hook.  See the breakdown of the save lifecycle in the `save`
        documentation above for more details.

        (when the `name` is `"Jane"`, `is_anonymous` is False.  We then update the name and set it to an empty
        string, and `is_anonymous` becomes True.  We then update one last time to set a name again and
        `is_anonymous` becomes False.

        Make the model queryable.

        This is used to remove the ambiguity of attempting execute a query against a model object that stores a record.

        The reason this exists is because the model class is used both to query as well as to operate on single records, which can cause
        subtle bugs if a developer accidentally confuses the two usages.  Consider the following (partial) example:

        ```python
        def some_function(models):
            model = models.find("id=5")
            if model:
                models.save({"test": "example"})
            other_record = model.find("id=6")
        ```

        In the above example it seems likely that the intention was to use `model.save()`, not `models.save()`.  Similarly, the last line
        should be `models.find()`, not `model.find()`.  To minimize these kinds of issues, clearskies won't let you execute a query against
        an individual model record, nor will it let you execute a save against a model being used to make a query.  In both cases, you'll
        get an exception from clearskies, as the models track exactly how they are being used.

        In some rare cases though, you may want to start a new query aginst a model that represents a single record.  This is most common
        if you have a function that was passed an individual model, and you'd like to use it to fetch more records without having to
        inject the model class more generally.  That's where the `as_query()` method comes in.  It's basically just a way of telling clearskies
        "yes, I really do want to start a query using a model that represents a record".  So, for example:

        ```python
        def some_function(models):
            model = models.find("id=5")
            more_models = model.where("test=example")  # throws an exception.
            more_models = model.as_query().where("test=example")  # works as expected.

        Add a condition to a query.

        The `where` method (in combination with the `find` method) is typically the starting point for query records in
        a model.  You don't *have* to add a condition to a model in order to fetch records, but of course it's a very
        common use case.  Conditions in clearskies can be built from the columns or can be constructed as SQL-like
        string conditions, e.g. `model.where("name=Bob")` or `model.where(model.name.equals("Bob"))`.  The latter
        provides strict type-checking, while the former does not.  Either way they have the same result.  The list of
        supported operators for a given column can be seen by checking the `_allowed_search_operators` attribute of the
        column class.  Most columns accept all allowed operators, which are:

         - "<=>"
         - "!="
         - "<="
         - ">="
         - ">"
         - "<"
         - "="
         - "in"
         - "is not null"
         - "is null"
         - "like"

        When working with string conditions, it is safe to inject user input into the condition.  The allowed
        format for conditions is very simple: `f"{column_name}\\s?{operator}\\s?{value}"`.  This makes it possible to
        unambiguously separate all three pieces from eachother.  It's not possible to inject malicious payloads into either
        the column names or operators because both are checked against a strict allow list (e.g. the columns declared in the
        model or the list of allowed operators above).  The value is then extracted from the leftovers, and this is
        provided to the backend separately so it can use it appropriately (e.g. using prepared statements for the cursor
        backend).  Of course, you generally shouldn't have to inject user input into conditions very often because, most
        often, the various list/search endpoints do this for you, but if you have to do it there are no security
        concerns.

        You can include a table name before the column name, with the two separated by a period.  As always, if you do this,
        ensure that you include a supporting join statement (via the `join` method - see it for examples).

        When you call the `where` method it returns a new model object with it's query configured to include the additional
        condition.  The original model object remains unchanged.  Multiple conditions are always joined with AND.  There is
        no explicit option for OR.  The closest is using an IN condition.

        To access the results you have to iterate over the resulting model.  If you are only expecting one result
        and want to work directly with it, then you can use `model.find(condition)` or `model.where(condition).first()`.

        Example:
        ```python
        import clearskies


        class Order(clearskies.Model):
            id_column_name = "id"
            backend = clearskies.backends.MemoryBackend()

        Add a join clause to the query.

        As with the `where` method, this expects a string which is parsed accordingly.  The syntax is not as flexible as
        SQL and expects a format of:

        ```
        [left|right|inner]? join [right_table_name] ON [right_table_name].[right_column_name]=[left_table_name].[left_column_name].
        ```

        This is case insensitive.  Aliases are allowed.  If you don't specify a join type it defaults to inner.
        Here are two examples of valid join statements:

         - `join orders on orders.user_id=users.id`
         - `left join user_orders as orders on orders.id=users.id`

        Note that joins are not strictly limited to SQL-like backends, but of course no all backends will support joining.

        expect to be given a `start` parameter, while an API backend will vary with the API, and the dynamodb backend
        expects a kwarg called `cursor`.  As a result, it's necessary to check the backend documentation to understand
        how to properly set pagination.  The endpoints automatically account for this because backends are required

        are required to define how pagination works in a way that clearskies can automatically understand and

        from returning everything, and then uses `paginate_all` to fetch all records.  The memory backend
