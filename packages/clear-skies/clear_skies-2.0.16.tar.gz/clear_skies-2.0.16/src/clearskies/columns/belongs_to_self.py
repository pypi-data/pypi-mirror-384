    This is a standard BelongsToId column except it's used in cases where the model relates to itself.

    This exists because a model can't refer to itself inside it's own class definition.  There are
    workarounds, but having this class is usually quicker for the developer.

    The only difference between this and BelongsToId is that you don't have to provide the parent class.
