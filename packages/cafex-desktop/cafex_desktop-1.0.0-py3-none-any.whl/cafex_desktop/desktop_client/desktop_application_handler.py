        Retrieve and launch the appropriate application handler.

        This method determines which application to launch based on the provided `application_name` or the
        configuration. It supports launching predefined applications like Excel and Notepad, or a custom
        application specified in the configuration.

        Args:
            app_path(str): The path to the application to launch. If not provided, the method will use the
                                    `app_path` value from the configuration.
            application_name (str): The name of the application to launch. If not provided, the method will
                                    use the `application` value from the configuration.

        Returns:
            None: The method launches the application and does not return any value.

        Raises:
            Exception: If an error occurs while launching the application.

        Examples:
            1. Launch Excel:
