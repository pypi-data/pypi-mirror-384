 abstract = {Coastal and marine tourism is a growing sector, in terms of both participation and economic relevance. For its enjoyment and safety, coastal and marine recreation requires suitable weather conditions, and attractive environments. Climate change will impact both. At the same time, tourism is an important source of the greenhouse gases (GHG) that are causing climate change. To date, and with the exception of beach recreation, most studies on climate change and tourism have concentrated either on impacts on whole countries and world regions or on certain ecosystems like coasts, focusing their attention in only one activity and overlooking the great diversity and very different weather requirements of the rest of activities these environments support. This paper reviews the importance of coastal and marine environments for recreation, presents current knowledge on the impacts of climate change on activities in these environments and identifies the main scientific gaps. This study provides an updated knowledge base for understanding climate change relationship with coastal and marine tourism and proposes a number of future research lines.},

abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to estimate the total output in an economy that is currently dependent (at least partially) on current fisheries output. We therefore applied the Leontief technological coefficients at current production and then estimate total output supported throughout the economy at the current level of production. Estimates of gross revenue from capture fisheries suggest that the direct value of output for this sector is US $80–85 billion annually (Sumaila et al., Journal of Bioeconomics 9(1):39–51, 2007; Willmann et al., The Sunken Billions, World Bank, FAO, Washington DC, Rome, 2009). However, as a primary or a potential economic base industry, there are a vast number of secondary economic activities—from boat building to international transport—that are supported by world fisheries, yet these related activities are rarely considered when evaluating the economic impact of fisheries. This study applies an input–output methodology to estimate the total direct, indirect, and induced impact of marine capture fisheries on the world economy. While results suggest that there is a great deal of variation in fishing output multipliers between regions and countries, when we apply the output multipliers to the capture fisheries sector at the global level, we find that significant indirect and induced effects place the impact of this sector to world output nearly three times larger than the value of landings at first sale, at between US $225 and 240 billion per year.},

abstract = {Estimates of ocean CO2 uptake from global ocean biogeochemistry models and p⁢CO2-based data products differ substantially, especially in high latitudes and in the trend of the CO2 uptake since 2000. Here, we assess the effect of data sparsity on two p⁢CO2-based estimates by subsampling output from a global ocean biogeochemistry model. The estimates of the ocean CO2 uptake are improved from a sampling scheme that mimics present-day sampling to an ideal sampling scheme with 1000 evenly distributed sites. In particular, insufficient sampling has given rise to strong biases in the trend of the ocean carbon sink in the p⁢CO2 products. The overestimation of the CO2 flux trend by 20–35% globally and 50–130% in the Southern Ocean with the present-day sampling is reduced to less than 15% with the ideal sampling scheme. A substantial overestimation of the decadal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink occurs in one product and appears related to a skewed data distribution in p⁢CO2 space. With the ideal sampling, the bias in the mean CO2 flux is reduced from 9–12% to 2–9% globally and from 14–26% to 5–17% in the Southern Ocean. On top of that, discrepancies of about 0.4 PgC yr−1 (15%) persist due to uncertainties in the gas-exchange calculation.},

abstract = {Abstract Machine learning algorithms have become very popular for spatial mapping of the environment due to their ability to fit nonlinear and complex relationships. However, this ability comes with the disadvantage that they can only be applied to new data if these are similar to the training data. Since spatial mapping requires predictions to new geographic space which in many cases goes along with new predictor properties, a method to assess the area to which a prediction model can be reliably applied is required. Here, we suggest a methodology that delineates the ‘area of applicability’ (AOA) that we define as the area where we enabled the model to learn about relationships based on the training data, and where the estimated cross-validation performance holds. We first propose a ‘dissimilarity index’ (DI) that is based on the minimum distance to the training data in the multidimensional predictor space, with predictors being weighted by their respective importance in the model. The AOA is then derived by applying a threshold which is the (outlier-removed) maximum DI of the training data derived via cross-validation. We further use the relationship between the DI and the cross-validation performance to map the estimated performance of predictions. We illustrate the approach in a simulated case study chosen to mimic ecological realities and test the credibility by using a large set of simulated data. The simulation studies showed that the prediction error within the AOA is comparable to the cross-validation error of the trained model, while the cross-validation error does not apply outside the AOA. This applies to models being trained with randomly distributed training data, as well as when training data are clustered in space and where spatial cross-validation is applied. Using the relationship between DI and cross-validation performance showed potential to limit predictions to the area where a user-defined performance applies. We suggest to add the AOA computation to the modeller's standard toolkit and to present predictions for the AOA only. We further suggest to report a map of DI-dependent performance estimates alongside prediction maps and complementary to (cross-)validation performance measures and the common uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract={Oceanic emissions represent a highly uncertain term in the natural atmospheric methane (CH4) budget, due to the sparse sampling of dissolved CH4 in the marine environment. Here we overcome this limitation by training machine-learning models to map the surface distribution of methane disequilibrium (∆CH4). Our approach yields a global diffusive CH4 flux of 2--6TgCH4yr−1 from the ocean to the atmosphere, after propagating uncertainties in ∆CH4 and gas transfer velocity. Combined with constraints on bubble-driven ebullitive fluxes, we place total oceanic CH4 emissions between 6--12TgCH4yr−1, narrowing the range adopted by recent atmospheric budgets (5--25TgCH4yr−1) by a factor of three. The global flux is dominated by shallow near-shore environments, where CH4 released from the seafloor can escape to the atmosphere before oxidation. In the open ocean, our models reveal a significant relationship between ∆CH4 and primary production that is consistent with hypothesized pathways of in situ methane production during organic matter cycling.},

  abstract = {N2O is a potent greenhouse gas whose oceanic emissions are still poorly constrained. Here, we reconstruct oceanic N2O emissions from the largest observational synthesis to date, substantially reducing the uncertainty compared to previous estimates and enabling a tightening of the global budget of this gas. We also reveal a vigorous global seasonal cycle, dominated by productive, low-oxygen tropical regions, which suggests sensitivity of the N2O cycle to natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. Assessment of the global budget of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is limited by poor knowledge of the oceanic N2O flux to the atmosphere, of which the magnitude, spatial distribution, and temporal variability remain highly uncertain. Here, we reconstruct climatological N2O emissions from the ocean by training a supervised learning algorithm with over 158,000 N2O measurements from the surface ocean—the largest synthesis to date. The reconstruction captures observed latitudinal gradients and coastal hot spots of N2O flux and reveals a vigorous global seasonal cycle. We estimate an annual mean N2O flux of 4.2 ± 1.0 Tg N⋅y−1, 64\% of which occurs in the tropics, and 20\% in coastal upwelling systems that occupy less than 3\% of the ocean area. This N2O flux ranges from a low of 3.3 ± 1.3 Tg N⋅y−1 in the boreal spring to a high of 5.5 ± 2.0 Tg N⋅y−1 in the boreal summer. Much of the seasonal variations in global N2O emissions can be traced to seasonal upwelling in the tropical ocean and winter mixing in the Southern Ocean. The dominant contribution to seasonality by productive, low-oxygen tropical upwelling systems (\&gt;75\%) suggests a sensitivity of the global N2O flux to El Niño–Southern Oscillation and anthropogenic stratification of the low latitude ocean. This ocean flux estimate is consistent with the range adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but reduces its uncertainty by more than fivefold, enabling more precise determination of other terms in the atmospheric N2O budget.}

  abstract = {Abstract Aim Large databases of species records such as those generated through citizen science projects, archives or museum collections are being used with increasing frequency in species distribution modelling (SDM) for conservation and land management. Despite the broad spatial and temporal coverage of the data, its application is often limited by the issue of sampling bias and consequently, zero inflation; there are more zeros (which are potentially ‘false absences’) in the data than expected. Here, we demonstrate how pooling species presence data into a ‘pseudo-abundance’ count can allow identification and removal of sampling bias through the use of zero-inflated (ZI) models, and thus solve a common SDM problem. Location All locations Taxon All taxa Methods We present the results of a series of simulations based on hypothetical ecological scenarios of data collection using random and non-random sampling strategies. Our simulations assume that the locations of occurrence records are known at a high spatial resolution, but that the absence of occurrence records may reflect under-sampling. To simulate pooling of presence–absence or presence-only data, we count occurrence records at intermediate and coarse spatial resolutions, and use ZI models to predict the counts (species abundance per grid cell) from environmental layers. Results ZI models can successfully identify predictors of bias in species data and produce abundance prediction maps that are free from that bias. This phenomenon holds across multiple spatial scales, thereby presenting an advantage over presence-only SDM methods such as binomial GLMs or MaxEnt, where information about species density is lost, and model performance declines at coarser scales. Main Conclusions Our results highlight the value of converting presence–absence or presence-only species data to ‘pseudo-abundance’ and using ZI models to address the problem of sampling bias. This method has huge potential for ecological researchers when using large species datasets for research and conservation.},
