Coccolithophore abundance in the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series 
*************************************************************

In this example we will use Abil to predict the biomass of the calcifying nanoplankton ('Coccolithophores').
We will focus on the species *Gephyrocapsa huxleyi* which is highly abundant in the global oceans, and plays an important role in the carbon cycle.
We fill focus this example on the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS), a location with great temporal coverage of *G. huxleyi*.
In this location, wind-driven mixing in the winter drives nutrient upwelling which results in high concentrations of *G. huxleyi*.
In the summer, as nutrient influx decreases due to lower mixing the abundance of *G. huxleyi* subsequently decreases :footcite:p:`haidar2001coccolithophore`. 
An interesting temporal dynamic we will try to capture with our machine learning ensemble. 

As *Gephyrocapsa huxleyi* is present in low concentrations most of the year, we will use a 1-phase regression model.
For an example of the 2-phase model see :doc:`Southern Ocean distribution of Gephyrocapsa huxleyi <two-phase-ensemble>`. 

YAML example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running the model, model specifications need to be defined in a YAML file. 
For a detailed explanation of each parameter see :ref:`yaml_config`.

An example of YAML file of a 1-phase model is provided below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.yml
   :language: yaml


Running the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After specifying the model configuration in the relevant YAML file, we can use the Abil API
to 1) tune the model, evaluating the model performance across different hyper-parameter values and then 
selecting the best configuration 2) predict in-sample and out-of-sample observations based on the optimal
hyper-parameter configuration identified in the first step 3) conduct post-processing such as exporting
relevant performance metrics, spatially or temporally integrated target estimates, and diversity metrics.


Loading dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before running the Python script we need to import all relevant Python packages.
For instructions on how to install these packages, see `requirements.txt <../../../../../requirements.txt>`_
and the Abil :ref:`getting-started`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 4-18
   :language: python

Loading the configuration YAML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After loading the required packages we need to define our file paths.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 20
   :language: python

Then we can load the YAML:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 22-24
   :language: python

Loading example data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we load some example data, here we utilize abundance data from the CASCADE database :footcite:p:`deVries2024cascade`.
The CASCADE database provides observations gridded to 1 degree x 1 degree x 5 meters x 1 month. 
For the example we have subset the data for Bermuda and have averaged the observations with latitude and longitude. 
In addition to our predictors (`y_train`) we also need environmental data which match our predictions ('X_train'). 
This data was obtained from monthly climatologies from data sources such as the World Ocean Atlas :footcite:p:`Reagan2024`, NNGv2  :footcite:p:`Broullon2019, Broullon2020` and Castant et al., 2024  :footcite:p:`Castant2024`.

When applying the pipeline to your own data, note that the data
needs to be in a `Pandas DataFrame format <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 26-34
   :language: python

Plotting example data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can have a look at the example data. It already has pretty good data coverage.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 36-54
   :language: python

.. figure:: ../../../examples/BATS_observations.png

Training the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we train our model. Note that depending on the number of hyper-parameters specified in the
YAML file this can be computationally very expensive and it recommended to do this on a HPC system. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 56-60
   :language: python

Making predictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After training our model we can make predictions on the BATS environmental dataset:

First we need to load our environmental data to make the predictions on (X_predict):

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 62-65
   :language: python

We can also quickly plot the environmental data. Note the seasonality in key parameters such as PAR and temperature.


.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 67-77
   :language: python

.. figure:: ../../../examples/BATS_environment.png


Then we can make our predictions:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 79-81
   :language: python

Post-processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we conduct the post-processing.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 83-91
   :language: python

Plotting
^^^^^^^^

Now that we have predictions we can plot them:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 93-106
   :language: python

.. figure:: ../../../examples/BATS_predictions.png

Model performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We can also check the stats

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 108-110
   :language: python

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print(
   >>>   f"error metrics:\n"
   >>>   f"R2 = {obs_abundance['R2'][0]:.2f}\n"
   >>>   f"relative RMSE = {obs_abundance['rRMSE'][0]*100:.2f} (%)\n"
   >>>   f"relative MAE = {obs_abundance['rMAE'][0]*100:.2f} (%)"
   >>> )
   error metrics:
   R2 = 0.20
   relative RMSE = 156.20 (%)
   relative MAE = 121.10 (%)

And plot the predictions vs observations:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/regressor.py
   :lines: 119-137
   :language: python

.. figure:: ../../../examples/BATS_obs_preds.png
