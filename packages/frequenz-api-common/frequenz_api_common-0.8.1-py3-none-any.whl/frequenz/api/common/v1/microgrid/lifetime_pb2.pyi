    """Lifetime captures the timestamps indicating the active operational period of
    a microgrid asset, such as a component, connection, sensor, or any other
    entity with a limited operational lifetime.

    It is normally used to track the historical evolution of assets, and it
    determines the validity period for the asset's data.

    If the `start_timestamp` is not set, the asset is considered to be in
    operation since the beginning of the system's operational history.

    If the `end_timestamp` is not set, the asset is considered to be in
    operation indefinitely into the future.

    If the Lifetime message is completely missing, it means both timestamps are
    not set, which means the asset is considered to be in operation since the
    beginning of the system's operational history and indefinitely into the
    future.
