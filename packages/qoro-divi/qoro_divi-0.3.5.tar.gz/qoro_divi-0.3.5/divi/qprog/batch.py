            are needed to achieve the objective of the job. The creation of those
            programs can utilize the instance variables of the class to initialize
            their parameters. The programs should be stored in a key-value store
            where the keys represent the identifier of the program, whether random
            or identificatory.

        2. `aggregate_results`: This function aggregates the results of the programs
            after they are done executing. This function should be aware of the different
            formats the programs might have (counts dictionary, expectation value, etc) and
            handle such cases accordingly.
