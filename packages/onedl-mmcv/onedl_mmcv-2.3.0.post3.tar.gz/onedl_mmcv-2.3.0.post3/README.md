## Highlights

The VBTI development team is reviving MMLabs code, making it work with
newer pytorch versions and fixing bugs. We are only a small team, so your help
is appreciated. We will officially drop support for the 1.x branch.

The OpenMMLab team released a new generation of training engine [MMEngine](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmengine) at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference on September 1, 2022. It is a foundational library for training deep learning models. Compared with MMCV, it provides a universal and powerful runner, an open architecture with a more unified interface, and a more customizable training process.

MMCV v2.0.0 official version was released on April 6, 2023. In version 2.x, it removed components related to the training process and added a data transformation module. Also, starting from 2.x, it renamed the package names **mmcv** to **mmcv-lite** and **mmcv-full** to **mmcv**. For details, see [Compatibility Documentation](docs/en/compatibility.md).

## Introduction

MMCV is a foundational library for computer vision research and it provides the following functionalities:

- [Image/Video processing](https://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/data_process.html)
- [Image and annotation visualization](https://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/visualization.html)
- [Image transformation](https://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/data_transform.html)
- [Various CNN architectures](https://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/cnn.html)
- [High-quality implementation of common CPU and CUDA ops](https://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/ops.html)

It supports the following systems:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

See the [documentation](http://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for more features and usage.

Note: MMCV requires Python 3.7+.

## Installation

There are two versions of MMCV:

- **mmcv**: comprehensive, with full features and various CUDA ops out of the box. It takes longer time to build.
- **mmcv-lite**: lite, without CUDA ops but all other features, similar to mmcv\<1.0.0. It is useful when you do not need those CUDA ops.

**Note**: Do not install both versions in the same environment, otherwise you may encounter errors like `ModuleNotFound`. You need to uninstall one before installing the other. `Installing the full version is highly recommended if CUDA is available`.

### Install mmcv

Before installing mmcv, make sure that PyTorch has been successfully installed following the [PyTorch official installation guide](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation). For apple silicon users, please use PyTorch 1.13+.

The command to install mmcv:

```bash
pip install -U openmim
mim install onedl-mmcv
```

If you need to specify the version of mmcv, you can use the following command:

```bash
mim install onedl-mmcv==2.0.0
```

If you find that the above installation command does not use a pre-built package ending with `.whl` but a source package ending with `.tar.gz`, you may not have a pre-build package corresponding to the PyTorch or CUDA or mmcv version, in which case you can [build mmcv from source](https://onedl-mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/build.html).
