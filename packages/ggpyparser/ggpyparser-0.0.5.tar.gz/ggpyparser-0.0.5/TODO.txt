BUGS TO FIX:

1. regex =  r'<!--\s*(.*?)\s*-->\s*(.*?)(?=\s*<!--\s*\w+|$)' in parse_liquipedia_wc.parse_bracket
    - For future events, this regex can sometimes false positive onto other labels(e.g. <-- August 23, 2025 -->)
    - Need to find a better solution to find proper titles

2. BLAST/Bounty/2025/Spring/Qualifier and other blast events have really unpredictable prize pools
    - Current bandaid solution only works for consistent spanning

NEW FEATURES:
1. Make the wc and html outputs as much alike as possible - this can be difficult at times as there sometimes exist data in the wikicode which does not exist in the html

OTHER:
1. write documentation!
