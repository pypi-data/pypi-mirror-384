# snAPI
Our Snappy New API (short snAPI) is a powerful Python wrapper which enables seamless
communication and configuration with PicoQuant Time Correlated Single Photon Counting
Instruments (TCSPC devices). It harnesses the advantages of C++ for optimal speed and
performance and bridges the gap between the high-speed capabilities of your PicoQuant
TCSPC device and the ease of use and versatility of Python.
