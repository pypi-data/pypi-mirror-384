## Quickstart

* Make sure you have a Python installation with the `conda` package manager
  on your system. We currently recommend [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
* Run `make install`
* Run `./run_ginput.py --help` to see available subcommands
* For more detailed help, try `man ginput` after running `make install`. 
  (If that doesn't work, try `man man/build/man/ginput.1` from this 
  directory or add `man/build/man/` to your `MANPATH`).
  
For more install options, run `make help`. 

## Is it working correctly?

To check whether your installation is working, there are example .mod, .vmr, .map, 
and .map.nc files in `ginput/testing/test_input_data` that have been generated from
both GEOS-FPIT and GEOS-FP. While TCCON uses GEOS-FPIT, it requires a data subscription,
so you may prefer to use GEOS-FP. 

To verify you have installed and are using `ginput` correctly, we recommend you generate
at least the .mod and .vmr files for Lamont (site code "oc") on 1 Jan 2018 and compare
against the pregenerated test files. Differences should be less than ~1%. 

If you have GEOS FP-IT files available on your system, the script 
`ginput/testing/test_input_data/geosfp-it/link_geos_fpit_files.sh` will help link them 
to the correct location in this repo to run the automatic test case. `cd` to 
`ginput/testing/test_input_data/geosfp-it/` and run `./link_geos_fpit_files.sh --help`
to see its usage. This requires the following files:

* The 8 model level assimilated quantity files for 2018-01-01 (`GEOS.fpit.asm.inst3_3d_asm_Nv.GEOS5124.20180101*.nc4`)
* The 8 2D assimilated quantity files for 2018-01-01 (`GEOS.fpit.asm.inst3_2d_asm_Nx.GEOS5124.20180101*.nc4`)
* The 8 model level chemistry files for 2018-01-01 (`GEOS.fpit.asm.inst3_3d_chm_Nv.GEOS5124.20180101*.nc4`)

To run the test, the easiest way is to activate the conda environment that `ginput` was installed
in (`ginput-auto-default` if installed with `make install`) and run `make test`. This will take
several minutes to run. If tests fail because the output .mod/.vmr/.map files do not match the expected,
plots will be generated in `ginput/testing/plots` for you to inspect the differences and verify that
they are reasonable.

## Documentation

Man pages are created in `man/build/man/` during installation and can be accessed with e.g. `man man/build/man/ginput.1`.
These may also be added to your MANPATH so that e.g. `man ginput` works, but this is system dependent. Full documentation
is provided at https://ginput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Some additional documentation is provided on the TCCON wiki:

* [Running ginput](https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Main/UsingGinput)
* [Code structure](https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Main/GinputCodeStructure)

These will be folded into the readthedocs instance in the future.
