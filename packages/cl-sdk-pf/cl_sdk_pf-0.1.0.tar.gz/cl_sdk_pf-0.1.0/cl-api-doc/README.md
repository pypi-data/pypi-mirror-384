# CL API Documentation Pre-Release

This repository contains an early look at the CL API documentation for the Cortical Labs CL1 platform.

We hope to illustrate that anyone with a little bit of Python coding experience will be able to rapidly iterate on low-latency closed loop brain cell experiment designs.

Many important things have yet to be documented (or documented fully), and this repository will be updated as we head towards our product launch in March, and beyond.

Thank you for your interest. Please feel free to open GitHub issues if you would like to ask questions or provide feedback. We also invite you to join the [Cortical Labs Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XHnmQtrzDn), in particular the `CL-API` channel.

For more detailed information relating to our work, please refer to the [further information](https://corticallabs.com/info) page on our website.
