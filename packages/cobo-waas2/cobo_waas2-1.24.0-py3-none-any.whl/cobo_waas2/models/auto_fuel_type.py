    The mode of transaction fee payment using Fee Station. Currently, Fee Station supports EVM-compatible and TRON transactions initiated from MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) and Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets). For more details, refer to [Fee Station](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/fee-station/introduction). - `ProActiveAutoFuel`: Always use Fee Station to pay transaction fees. - `PassiveAutoFuel`: Use Fee Station only when the source address balance is insufficient to cover the transaction fees. - `UsePortalPreference`: Use payment preferences set on Cobo Portal.  Please note that the TRON chain does not support `PassiveAutoFuel` due to its fee delegation mechanism.
