## Contributions

Do not submit code to this project written or modified by large-scale language models or "artificial intelligence" tools
such as GitHub Copilot, Gitlab Duo or ChatGPT. These tools generate code that appears plausible but may contain bugs
that are difficult to find.

Furthermore, because these models were trained indiscriminately and without consent on open source code under various
licenses, it is not obvious that we have the moral or legal right to redistribute the code they generate.
