# Composabl

Composabl helps you build Autonomous Agents! Through an easy SDK you get access to outscaled simulator training tools.

## Licenses / Seats

Composabl is an enterprise platform and requires an API key to use.

We offer 3 types of licenses:

- **Enterprise:** for enterprise projects and agent creations
- **Personal:** for personal usage and testing (typically offered to System Integrators)
- **Trial:** validate the Composabl platform (requires sales contact person)

One key is needed per user (seat-based licensing)

You can request an API Key through the following methods:
