Audit logging library for Python

## Usage

`pip install iceye-audit-log`

Then in your applications:

`from audit_log.log import log`

And invoke it with the proper arguments.

## Contributing

This project is mostly for internal use, however it is made public as the concept of audit logging is quite generic.
We are careful about accepting contributions and those would have to align with our needs.
Reviews and issues will be considered time-permitting.
