# number of waves
# this number will be used to set the rest        
# of the discretization parameters

# ASGarD specific inputs, such as "-title"
# must include the command line "-"
-title     : Wave inputs test
-subtitle  : using 3 waves

number of waves : 3
cells per wave  : 8
# this will require 3 * 8 = 24 cell minimum
# will round up to the next power of 2, i.e., 32 cells
