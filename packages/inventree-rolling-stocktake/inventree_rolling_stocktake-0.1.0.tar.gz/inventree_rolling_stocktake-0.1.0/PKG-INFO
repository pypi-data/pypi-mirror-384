# Rolling Stocktake Plugin
 
This is as plugin for [InvenTree](https://inventree.org) which provides integration of rolling stocktake for InvenTree.

## Description

Rolling stocktake is a method of inventory management where a small subset of inventory is counted on a regular basis, rather than counting the entire inventory at once. This plugin provides tools to facilitate rolling stocktake operations within InvenTree.

### Features

The plugin provides the following features:

- A backend API endpoint to retrieve items which are due for stocktake
- A frontend interface to view and manage rolling stocktake operations

### Dashboard Widget

Users are presented with a custom widget on their dashboard, which automatically fetches a single stock item which is due for stocktake:

This widget allows users to quickly and easily perform stocktake operations on individual items. Once stocktake has been performed on a given item, the next item which is due for stocktake is automatically fetched.

## Installation

Install the plugin using the methods described below.

*Note: After the plugin is installed, it must be activated via the InvenTree plugin interface.*

### Via User Interface
