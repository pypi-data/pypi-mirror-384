([Issue #35](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/35))\r\n* Implemented caching for AppleTV's storefront configuration data, which should reduce the amount of requests used when scraping multiple AppleTV URLs from the same storefront.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n* Big backend changes to the structure of the code, mostly to improve modularity and allow for easier development in the future, and improve performance.\r\n* Updated the CLI output to utilize logs and print with colors according to log-level.\r\n* Improved error handling in some cases where an invalid URL is used.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed an issue where if a movie is a pre-order with a set release date, a message with availability date wouldn't be printed in some cases.\r\n---\r\n## 2.4.3 [2023-06-18]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where some AppleTV URLs (or iTunes links that refer to such URLs) would not be matched in some cases, resulting in a \"No matching scraper was found...\" error.
