# Personal utilities package for Python

Package with various utilities i.e. VB regex translation, CLI logging, file handling, basic GUI wrapper ...

## Features

Set of submodules contains:

- submodule for converting  Microsoft VB /COM type regular expression to Python regular expression
- submodule with utilities to log CLI calls of Python scripts
- submodule with utilities for file handling
- submodule with wrapper for basic GUI functions for various GUI frameworks
- submodule with various utilities - read config file with standard parser, set up standard logger object ...

Note: as I am coming from camel case notation I was struggling a little bit with the Python naming conventions.
However, for publishing I tried to increase compliance with Python naming conventions and added snake case
method stubs (at least for most important subroutines) as a compromise.

## Development

To set up [hatch] and [pre-commit] for the first time:

1. install [hatch] globally, e.g. with [pipx], i.e. `pipx install hatch`,
2. make sure `pre-commit` is installed globally, e.g. with `pipx install pre-commit`.

A special feature that makes hatch very different from other familiar tools is that you almost never
activate, or enter, an environment. Instead, you use `hatch run env_name:command` and the `default` environment
is assumed for a command if there is no colon found. Thus you must always define your environment in a declarative
way and hatch makes sure that the environment reflects your declaration by updating it whenever you issue
a `hatch run ...`. This helps with reproducability and avoids forgetting to specify dependencies since the
hatch workflow is to specify everything directly in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). Only in rare cases, you
will use `hatch shell` to enter the `default` environment, which is similar to what you may know from other tools.

To get you started, use `hatch run test:cov` or `hatch run test:no-cov` to run the unitest with or without coverage reports,
respectively. Use `hatch run lint:all` to run all kinds of typing and linting checks. Try to automatically fix linting
problems with `hatch run lint:fix` and use `hatch run docs:serve` to build and serve your documentation.
You can also easily define your own environments and commands. Check out the environment setup of hatch
in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for more commands as well as the package, build and tool configuration.

To support versioning and changelog generation please refer to the toolchain selected during package
generation (see also `pyproject.toml`). If not deselected, the toolchain includes a [pre-commit] hook
for linting commit messages to ensure commit messages are compliant with the conventional commit format and
support an automated changelog generation.
