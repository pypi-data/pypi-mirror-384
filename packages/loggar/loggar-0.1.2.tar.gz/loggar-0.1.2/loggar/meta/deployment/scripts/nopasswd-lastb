# into the /etc/sudoers.d directory to suppress this.
#
# The following deployment steps are to be followed *if* the sudo password
# prompt has not already been disabled in another way, for the lastb 
# command.
#
# Deployment steps:
#   1) For all applicable hosts, copy this script to: /etc/sudoers.d
#   2) Update USERNAME to the username which will be calling the lastb
#      command.
