  </a>
</p>

## Key features

- **Mixed-dimensional quantum circuit support**: Design, simulate, and analyze quantum circuits with arbitrary qudit dimensions, not limited to qubits. [Tutorial](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qudits/en/latest/tutorial.html)
- **Python-first API**: Intuitive Python interface for circuit construction, simulation, and analysis, with type hints and integration with scientific Python libraries.
- **Cross-platform and open-source**: C++20 core with Python bindings, prebuilt wheels for Linux, macOS, and Windows via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits/).

If you have any questions, feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits).

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
Among others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

## Getting Started

`mqt.qudits` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits/).

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.qudits
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qudits).**

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the functionalities of MQT Qudits are illustrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=due_CX7H85A).

## System Requirements and Building

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.24 or newer.
For details on how to build the project, please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qudits).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT Qudits is compatible with all [officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
