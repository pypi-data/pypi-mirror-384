    Given the linear model fitting problem
    presented in :mod:`this page <.linear_model_fitting>`,
    this algorithm solves a penalized least squares problem of the form:

    .. math::

       \min_w \|Xw-y\|_2^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \|w\|_0\leq \eta

    where :math:`\eta` is a specific number of non-zero components of :math:`w`.

    Alternatively:

    .. math::

       \min_w \|w\|_0 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \|Xw-y\|_2^2\leq \tau

    where :math:`\tau` is a specific model error.
