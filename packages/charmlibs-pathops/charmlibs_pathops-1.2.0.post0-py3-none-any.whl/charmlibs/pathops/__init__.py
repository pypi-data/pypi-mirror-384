r""":mod:`pathlib`-like interface for local and :class:`ops.Container` filesystem paths.

The ``pathops`` charm library provides:

- :class:`PathProtocol`: defines the interface of methods common to both local and container paths.
  Use this to type annotate code designed to work on both Kubernetes and machine charms.
- :class:`ContainerPath`: the concrete implementation of the interface for remote paths in the
  workload container of Kubernetes charms. Operations are implemented using the Pebble file API.
- :class:`LocalPath`: the concrete implementation of the interface for local paths, which includes
  both machine charms and the charm container of Kubernetes charms. Inherits from
  :class:`pathlib.PosixPath` and extends the signature of some methods.
- Top-level helper functions such as :func:`ensure_contents`, which operate on both container
  and local paths.

:class:`ContainerPath` methods that interact with the remote filesystem will raise a
:class:`PebbleConnectionError` if the workload container isn't reachable.
Methods designed to work with both local and container paths may handle this error internally,
or they may leave handling connection errors to the caller, documenting this if so.
