    """Find overlapping reads on host and possible integrated genes

    This script scans a BAM file and identifies reads that map onto a gene name provided
    by the user. Then, it checks whether these reads also map onto the other gene names.

    This is very convenient to search for an integrated plasmid or gene in a host.
    For instance a transgene in a mammal genome.

    The candidate reads are saved in various files:
    - a NAME_info.csv file with information about reads that were found of interest.
      The header is M,S,H,I,D,flag,chr,position,identifier. M, S, H, I and D indicates
      the number of bases that map (M), are soft clipped (S), hard clipped (H), inserted (I),
      or deleted (D). We also add the flag (type of mapping), the chromosome and
      position (chr, position) and finally the read identifier.
    - a NAME_reads_IDs.csv that contains the unique identifier reads
    - a FastQ if --save-reads-as-fastq option is used
    - a FastA if --save-reads-as-fasta option is used

    Note that secondary reads are ignored (flag 256, 272).

    We also removed reads that map at a single place (no overlap).

    To obtain the BAM files, you can use the sequana_mapper pipeline (https://github.com/sequana/mapper).

    The BAM file should be indexed with samtools for better performances.
