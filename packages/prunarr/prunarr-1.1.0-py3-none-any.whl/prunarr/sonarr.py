Sonarr API client module for PrunArr CLI application.

This module provides a comprehensive interface to the Sonarr API for TV series and episode
management operations. It wraps the pyarr library while adding advanced functionality for
episode tracking, file size management, and season-level operations.

The SonarrAPI class serves as an enhanced facade over pyarr.SonarrAPI, providing:
- Comprehensive series and episode retrieval with metadata
- Advanced episode file management and size tracking
- Season-based organization and statistics
- Direct API access for complex operations bypassing pyarr limitations
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Detailed episode-to-file mapping for storage analysis

            episode counts, and download statistics

        Examples:
            >>> summary = sonarr.get_series_episodes_summary(123)
            >>> print(f"Series has {summary['total_seasons']} seasons")
            >>> print(f"Downloaded: {summary['downloaded_episodes']}/{summary['total_episodes']}")
            >>>
            >>> for season in summary['seasons']:
            ...     s_num = season['season_number']
            ...     downloaded = season['downloaded_episodes']
            ...     total = season['total_episodes']
            ...     print(f"Season {s_num}: {downloaded}/{total} episodes")

        Note:
            The summary includes all seasons including specials (season 0)
            and provides both individual season and series-wide statistics.
