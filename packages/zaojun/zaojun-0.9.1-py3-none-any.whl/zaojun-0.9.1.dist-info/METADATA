zaojun is a command line (CLI) tool to check versions of your dependencies as defined in `pyproject.toml`
file against the latest version published on `PyPi`_

Install and run from `Source <https://codeberg.org/marvin8/zaojun>`_
==============================================================================================

Alternatively you can run zaojun from source by cloning the repository using the following command line::

    git clone https://codeberg.org/marvin8/zaojun.git

zaojun uses `uv`_ for dependency control, please install UV before proceeding further.

Before running, make sure you have all required python modules installed. With uv this is as easy as::

    uv sync

Run zaojun with the command `uv run zaojun`

As a `pre-commit`_ hook
=========================

To run zaojun as a `pre-commit`_ hook, just add the below snippet into your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - repo: https://codeberg.org/marvin8/zaojun
   rev: 0.9.0
   hooks:
     - id: zaojun
       args:
       - "--groups"


Significance of Name zaojun
===========================

Zao Jun is the Chinese god that acts as a household guardian, overseeing domestic harmony and reporting family conduct to the heavensâ€”reinforcing moral behavior within the kin unit.
This tool tries to keep your project and its dependencies in harmony. It doesn't do any reporting to third parties though :)

I know is a little far fetched, but I like it, so there :)
