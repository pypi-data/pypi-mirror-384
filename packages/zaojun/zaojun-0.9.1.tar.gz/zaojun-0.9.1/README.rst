Significance of Name zaojun
===========================

Zao Jun is the Chinese god that acts as a household guardian, overseeing domestic harmony and reporting family conduct to the heavensâ€”reinforcing moral behavior within the kin unit.
This tool tries to keep your project and its dependencies in harmony. It doesn't do any reporting to third parties though :)

I know is a little far fetched, but I like it, so there :)
