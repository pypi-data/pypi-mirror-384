These schemas are used for Sales catalog JSON import/export and validation


Some implementation choices about what is included or not in the export:

ID FIELD :

BaseSaleProduct.id are included within the export. This id will be used as a
temporary reference at import time (ex: for the relationship
WorkItem.base_sale_product->BaseSaleProduct

RELATIONSHIPS:

For models related to the exported models, FKs are not exported, instead, they
are exported as nested structures, with two different cases:

- If the relationship (eg: category) is meant to be recreated on the importer server, they are
  exported with the maximum information, including the ID of the related
  instance
- if the relationship (ex: purchase_type) is meant to be mapped to an existing object on the importer server, they are exported with just the required fields to make a lookup
