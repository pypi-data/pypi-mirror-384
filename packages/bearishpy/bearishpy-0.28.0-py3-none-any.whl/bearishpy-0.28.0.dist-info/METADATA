# 🐻 Bearish

**Bearish** is a package for **querying financial and price data** from various equities across different countries, and **persisting it into a well-structured SQLite database** for further data analysis and stock screening.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

This package is intended for **active retail investors** with a strong passion for **data analysis**, who require well-structured, clean, and large datasets locally to:

- Run **custom technical and fundamental analysis**
- Perform in-depth **data analysis**
- Identify patterns and investment **insights**
- Build **custom screeners**

Bearish is **not designed for real-time trading**, but for extensive analysis of historical and current financial data.

---

## 🌍 Global Scope

Bearish is designed to collect large-scale data from exchanges in different countries. It **fetches data politely** — meaning it does not make large-scale concurrent API calls and instead respects the rate limits and policies of each data provider. So, **patience is required** during large data retrieval.

The data fetched includes:

- Historical **price data**
- Company **fundamentals**
- **Balance sheets**, **income statements**, and more

All data is stored in a **local SQLite database** from which you can query, analyze, and build insights.

---

## 📊 Data Sources

Bearish pulls data from multiple sources:

- [📦 FinanceDatabase](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase) for basic ticker information
- [🌐 InvestPy](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy) for country-level equity listings
- [📉 yFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) as the primary source of prices and fundamentals
- [📊 Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)](https://financialmodelingprep.com/)
- [🔍 AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- [📈 Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com/)

> Ticker information is **enriched** using additional sources like yFinance, FMP, etc.  
> Bearish is also **extensible** — you can add support for any data source or API.

By default, Bearish relies primarily on **yFinance** due to limitations in free-tier APIs of other providers. However, if you have a **premium subscription**, you can use other sources more fully.

---

## 📥 Installation

Install Bearish with pip:

```bash
pip install bearishpy
```

---

## 🚀 Fetch & Store Data

### 🏛️ Country-Level Data

Fetch and store stock data for selected countries:

```bash
bearish run /path/to/sqlite/db Belgium France --api-keys=config.json
```

✅ This command:

- Loads tickers from FinanceDatabase and InvestPy
- Filters relevant equities from the selected countries
- Enriches the data with fundamentals and prices
- Stores everything in your local SQLite database

> ⏱️ This operation can take some time depending on the size of the country’s exchange — data is fetched "politely", not in bulk.

Once your database is populated, future updates are quicker.

  "AlphaVantage": "your Alphavantage API key",
  "Tiingo": "your Tiingo API key"
