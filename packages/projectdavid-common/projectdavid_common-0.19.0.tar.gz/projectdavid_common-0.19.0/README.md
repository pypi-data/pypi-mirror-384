The **Projectdavid Common** SDK is a shared library that serves as a central resource for multiple components within the same
project. It consolidates common functionality across disparate parts of the project, reducing duplication and improving 
maintainability. By providing a unified interface, Entities Common simplifies interactions with the 
and future related products.
