    In this view, all registered users of the current Kadi4Mat instance are shown. Clicking on a user leads to a
    separate page, which contains another navigation menu, providing access to different subpages. The respective
    contents of these pages are briefly described below.

      On this page it is possible to see the basic information of a user, such as username and account type. Users are
      able to control some of the information shown on this page via the {{ a_open }}Settings{{ a_close }}.

      This page shows all accessible resources that a specific user created. When looking at other users, resources that
      were (explicitly) shared with a user, either directly or via groups, are shown as well, including common groups.

      This page is only visible to the current user. Here, deleted resources can be found, namely deleted records,
      collections, templates or groups. Resources can either be restored or deleted permanently. The latter will also
      happen automatically after {{ duration }}. Until then, the identifier of the deleted resources cannot be reused
      for newly created resources. Note that currently only the creator of a resource can restore or permanently delete
      it.
