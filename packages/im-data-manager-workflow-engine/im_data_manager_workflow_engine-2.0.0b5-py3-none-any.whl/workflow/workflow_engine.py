"""The WorkflowEngine - workflow execution logic.

This module realises workflow definitions, turning a definition into a controlled sequence
of Job executions. The Data Manager is responsible for storing and validating Workflows,
and this module is responsible for running them and reporting their state back to the
DM.

The engine is event-driven, responding to two types of message
(in the form of Protocol Buffers) - Workflow messages and a Pod messages.
These messages, sent from the DM Protocol Buffer Consumer (PBC), are delivered to the
engine via its 'handle_message()' method. The engine must react to these messages
appropriately by: -

-   Starting the execution of a new Workflow
    (when it receives a Workflow 'START' message)
-   Stopping the execution of an exiting Workflow
    (when it receives a Workflow 'STOP' message)
-   Progressing an exiting running workflow to its next Step
    (when it receives a Pod message)

When running a workflow, once the engine determines the action (the Step to run)
its most complex logic lies in the preparation of a set variables for the Step (Job).
This logic is confined to '_prepare_step()', which returns a 'StepPreparationResponse'
dataclass object. This object is used by the second key method in this module,
'_launch()'. The launch methods used the prepared variables and launches (using
a DM-provided 'InstanceLauncher' implementation) one or more Instances of a Step Job,
providing each with an appropriate set of command variables.

Module philosophy
-----------------
The module's role is to translate a pre-validated workflow definition into the ordered
execution of Step "Jobs" that manifest as Pod "Instances" running in a project directory
under the control of the DM.

Workflow messages are used to initiate (START) and terminate (STOP) workflows.
Pod messages signal the end of a previously launched step and carry the exit code
of the executed Job.

The engine uses START messages to launch the first "step" in a workflow, while Pod
messages signal the success (or failure) of a prior step. A step's success is used,
along with it's original workflow definition to determine the next action - either
the execution of a new step or the conclusion of the Workflow.

The engine does has no persistence and not create database records. Instead it relies
on an API 'wrapper' to retrieve records and alter them.

Objects that provide API and InstanceLauncher implementations are made available
to the engine when the DM creates it. passing them through the class initialiser.

The engine is designed not to retain any state persistence, it reacts to messages,
reconstructing its state based on Workflow, RunningWorkflow, and RunningWorkflowStep
records maintained by the DM. There's no real 'pattern' here - it's simply complex
custom sequential logic that is executed from the context of 'handle_message()'
that has to translate a workflow definition into running Job Instances.

If there is a pattern its closest approximation is probably a State pattern, closely
related to a Finite State Machine with the function 'handle_message()' used to alter
the engine's 'state'. The engine is in fact a complex running workflow 'state machine',
hence the term 'Engine' (another term for machine) used in its class name.

Only one instance of the engine is created by the DM so it also essentially exists as a
Singleton.

There are no sub-classes or other modules. Today all the state logic is captured
in this single module. There is no need to introduce level of redirection that simply
reduce the size of the file. There is a level of complexity that cannot be avoided -
the need to understand how to move a workflow forward and how to prepare a set of
variables for the next 'Step'.
