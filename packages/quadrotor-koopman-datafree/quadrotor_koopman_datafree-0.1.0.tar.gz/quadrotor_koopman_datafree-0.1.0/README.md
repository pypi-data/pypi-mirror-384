# quadrotor_koopman_datafree

A lightweight Python package for **Koopman-based data-free lifting of quadrotor dynamics on SE(3)**. This package analytically constructs lifted linear representations of quadrotor dynamics without requiring any trajectory data or machine learning. It supports both **NumPy** (numerical) and **CasADi** (symbolic) versions of the Koopman lifting maps for control and Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications.
