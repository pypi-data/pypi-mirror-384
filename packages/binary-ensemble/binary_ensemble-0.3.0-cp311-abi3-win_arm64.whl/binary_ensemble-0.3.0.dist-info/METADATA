# Py-BEN

BEN (short for Binary-Ensemble) is a compression algorithm designed for efficient storage and access
of ensembles of districting plans, and was designed to work primarily as a companion to the
GerrySuite collection of packages (GerryChain, GerryTools, FRCW) and to also be compatible with
other ensemble generators (e.g. ForestRecom, Sequential Monte Carlo [SMC]).

This is a package containing some Python bindings for the for the
[Binary-Ensemble](https://crates.io/crates/binary-ensemble) Rust library. In particular, this
package provides some easy tools for compressing and decompressing ensembles of districting plans,
as well as some utilities for working with ensembles stored in the BEN and XBEN formats.
