# img2term
A simple Python program that displays images in your terminal.
![Screenshot of program output](screenshot.png)

## Requirements
 - Python 3.13 or higher (older versions down to 3.8 might still work)
 - A terminal with 24-bit true color support. Some examples include:
    - [Ptyxis](https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis/) (used in the screenshot above)
    - [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/)
    - [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
    - [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
 - **NOTE:** The images may render more smoothly if the terminal supports GPU acceleration.

## Getting Started
The easiest way is to install via `pip`:
```bash
pip install img2term
```
Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myswang/img2term
cd img2term
# OPTIONAL: create a virtual environment
# python -m venv .venv
# source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To display a single image (i.e. `peacock.png`), you can run the program like so:
```bash
img2term peacock.png
```
The program will try to resize the image to fit within the terminal window. If you want the image to display in a smaller size, you can do so by setting `--max_width` and `--max_height`, which constrain the size of the image in terms of rows/columns.

For example, if you want the image to take up no more than 24 rows:
```
img2term peacock.png --max_height 24
```

## Supported File Formats
Any format that the Pillow library supports, including common formats like JPEG, PNG, and WEBP, should work. You can check out supported image formats [here](https://hugovk-pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html).
