## Overview

Posting has a *built-in help system*, which can be used to get information about the currently focused widget.

### Getting help for the focused widget

With a widget focused, press `f1` to open a help window for that widget.

Most widgets offer more keybindings and functionality than meets the eye, and more than what is shown in the application footer.

The help window explains how to use the focused widget, and lists all of the keybindings offered by it.
