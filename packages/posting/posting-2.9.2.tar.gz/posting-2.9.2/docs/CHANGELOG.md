## 2.9.0 [17th September 2025]

### Added

- Path parameter support (`:param` syntax) [(#295)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/295)
- New built-in themes: `hypernova`, `synthwave`. [(#300)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/300)
- Added `export: copy as YAML` command to the command palette [(#299)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/299)

## 2.8.0 [13th September 2025]

- Remove notification when creating + opening a new request.

## 2.7.1 [22nd July 2025]

### Fixed

- Pin tree-sitter to <0.25.0 to fix crash due to breaking API change.

## 2.7.0 [19th April 2025]

### Added

- Collections can now be imported from Postman [(#106)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/106)
- `posting.env` files in the current directory will automatically be loaded if no `--env` options are provided [(#249)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/249)
- Generate JSON body with default values after importing OpenAPI specs [(#247)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/247)
- Use tags to separate sub-collections in OpenAPI specs [(#247)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/247)
- curl import now handles various different data options [(#252)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/252)
- Added `-c` shorthand alias for `--collection` option [(#250)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/250)
- Added `posting sponsors` command, which lists people who have supported Posting via GitHub Sponsors (specific sponsor tiers only). [(#253)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/253)

### Changed

- A double-click rather than a single-click is now required to enter edit mode inside data tables (e.g. headers, query params, etc.) [(#256)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/256)
- In the body editor, the `Form data` menu item now shows `(x-www-form-urlencoded)` after the label, to suggest the type of data being sent. [(#259)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/259)

### Fixed

- Exported curl command uses `-d` for form data now, rather than `-F`. The result is exported commands with form data will now use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead of `multipart/form-data` (matching Posting's behaviour). [(#252)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/252)
- Fix attempting to add a protocol before applying variables in the URL bar [(#248)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/248)

## 2.6.0 [29th March 2025]

### Added

- Added `spacing: <compact|standard>` config to allow for a more compact UI (default: `standard`).
- Added ability to edit headers, form data, and query params without deleting and recreating them.
    - Press `enter` or click a row to enter edit mode. The row will be highlighted, and focus will move to the key/name input.
        Submitted changes will overwrite the existing row rather than adding a new one.
    - Press `v` to enter edit mode and immediately focus on the value input.
    - Press `escape` to cancel the edit.
    - Press `enter` to save the changes and exit edit mode.
    - The background colour behind the input will update to indicate edit mode is active.
- Added autocompletion for header values based on the header name.
    - For example, if the header is `Content-Type`, when typing the value, you'll be able to quickly autocomplete from a list of common content types.
- Press `/` to open the request search palette while the collection browser is focused.
    - `ctrl+shift+p` remains available as a global shortcut for this.
- Added `help: Open web docs` command to the command palette.
- Basic Vim motions to script output log (`hjkl`).
- Added response status code label to the URL bar.
- Contributing guide added to the GitHub repo (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

### Changed

- Rewrite of the autocompletion system used to autocomplete header names, values, URLs, and variables.
- Automatically prepend `http://` protocol if no protocol is specified in the URL bar.
- Debounce jump overlay recomposition - if you resize while the jump overlay is open, it'll wait a short period before recomputing.
- Jump mode now lives on the main screen, rather than globally. This makes more sense as it's only available on the main screen. The only user-facing impact should be that the position of the keybinding in the footer and keybindings panel may change.
- Jump mode interaction with Tabs now uses the Tabs API, rather than simulating a Click.
- Status code label now displayed in the URL bar beside the trace markers.
- Request description area at the bottom of the collection browser has new design.
- When there are no response cookies, the cookies section will now display a message to the user.
- Updated to Textual 3.0.0.
- Various updates to the https://posting.sh homepage.

### Fixed

- Fixed scrolling in response headers and cookies tabs using keyboard.
- Fixed crash when immediately pressing enter after loading the UI when the `on_startup` config is set to `url` (this was due to lazy loading of the UI, and attempting to send a request before the UI was fully loaded).
- Fixed accepting a completion via enter in the header editor also adding the header.
    - Now, the first enter press will accept the completion, and the second enter press will add the header.
- Fixed Textual markup not being escaped key value tables.
- Fixed request description attempting to parse Textual markup [(#243)](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting/pull/243)

## 2.5.4 [13th March 2025]

### Fixed

- Prioritise user-defined `User-Agent` header over Posting's default.

## 2.5.3 [13th March 2025]

### Changed

- Pin httpx and patch out httpx._main to prevent slow import (20ms saved at startup).
- Defer import of watchfiles until app is running (6ms saved at startup).
- Defer `HelpScreen` import until it's used (10ms saved at startup).

- Validation and corresponding UI feedback in New Request modal.

### Fixed

- Fixed crash when attempting to delete a request that doesn't exist on disk.

    - Undefined variables will be left as is (e.g. `$foo` will be left as `$foo` in the curl command)
- Setup scripts will now run by default when exporting to curl.
- Do not focus the URL bar when an error occurs on sending a request.
- Small visual refinement in `Scripts` tab.

## 2.4.0 [2nd March 2025]

### Added

- Added ability to quickly search for request by name and jump to it (press `ctrl+shift+p` to open the search popup).
- Added configurable keybinding `search-requests` (default: `ctrl+shift+p`).
- A few more screenshots were added to the "Navigation" guide.
- Added new headers to autocompletion: `Accept-Charset`, `DNT`, `Upgrade`, `Sec-Fetch-Site`, `Sec-Fetch-Mode`, `Sec-Fetch-User`, `Sec-Fetch-Dest`, and `Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload`.

- Info tab now shows "Request not saved to disk" if a request has not been saved to disk, rather than "None" or nothing at all.

## 2.0.0 [18th October 2024]

### Added

- **Scripting**: Run Python scripts before and after sending requests. Scripts can be used to perform setup, set variables, modify requests, and more.
    - Define "setup", "pre-request" and "post-request" Python functions and attach them to requests.
    - Posting will automatically reload these functions when they change, meaning you can edit them in an external editor while Posting is running.
    - Scripts can be used to directly manipulate the request, set variables which are used in the request (e.g. set a `$token` variable which is used in the request URL).
    - Output from scripts is captured and displayed in the "Scripts" tab.
- **Keymaps**: Change the default keybindings for any of Posting's "global" actions (e.g. sending request, opening jump mode, etc.) by editing `keymap` section of your `config.yaml` file.
- Added `heading.hostname` config to allow customisation of the hostname in the header. This field supports Rich markup. You may wish to use this to apply highlighting when `posting` is running on a production system vs a development environment, for example.
- Added `focus.on_request_open` config to automatically shift focus when a request is opened via the collection browser. For example, you might prefer to have focus jump to the "Body" tab when a request is opened.
- More detail and screenshots added to several sections of the guide.
    - Much more detail added to the "Getting Started" section.
    - Collections guide updated to explain more about the collection browser.
    - Guide for Keymaps added.
    - Guide for Scripting added.
    - Guide for External Tools added (integrating with vim, less, fx, etc.)
- `alt`+`enter` can now be used to send a request (in addition to the existing `ctrl+j` binding).
