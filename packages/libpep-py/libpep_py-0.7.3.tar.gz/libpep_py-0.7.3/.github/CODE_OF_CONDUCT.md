# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

At NOLAI (National Education Lab AI), we are committed to creating an open, inclusive, and collaborative environment for developing AI solutions that enhance education. We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct operates alongside the [Radboud University Code of Conduct](https://www.ru.nl/en/regulations/radboud-university-code-of-conduct).
## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the educational community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Data and Privacy Guidelines

As an educational research organization, we have strict guidelines regarding data:

* No student data, research data, or personally identifiable information should ever be committed to our repositories
* AI models trained on educational data must be published separately (e.g., on HuggingFace) and only after proper anonymization
* Our GitHub repositories are strictly for code that processes data, not for the data itself
* Contributors must respect and protect the privacy of all stakeholders in educational contexts

## Scientific Integrity

As an evidence-based organization:

* All scientific claims must be supported by published or pre-published research papers
* Contributors must clearly indicate when claims or features have not been scientifically verified
* Documentation should accurately represent the current state of evidence regarding educational effectiveness
* We encourage linking to relevant research papers and documentation

## AI Usage Guidelines

We support the responsible use of AI in contributions:

* AI-assisted coding and documentation tools are permitted and encouraged when used responsibly
* Contributors are fully responsible for reviewing and validating AI-generated content
* All contributions must comply with relevant licenses and copyright laws, regardless of how they were generated
* AI usage should be transparent and acknowledged when significant

## Language and Communication

* English is our primary language for code, documentation, and community interactions
* Interface elements may be provided in Dutch when appropriate
* Technical discussions and comments should be clear, constructive, and professional
* We encourage precise and inclusive technical communication

## Licensing and Intellectual Property
- All code repositories use the [Apache License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0) unless explicitly stated otherwise
- Contributors retain copyright to their contributions but grant license rights
- Derivative works must acknowledge original contributors
- Patents related to contributions must be licensed for free public use
