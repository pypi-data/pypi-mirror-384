Focus on code correctness, clarity, and maintainability across the entire set of changes.  
Add inline comments for:

- potential bugs or logical errors,
- inconsistent or confusing naming across files,
- redundant or duplicate code,
- improvements for readability or best practices.

Guidelines:

- Analyze all provided files together, but output comments in the same format as inline review.
- If there are many issues, prioritize the most important ones (maximum 50 comments).
- Keep comments short, actionable, and relevant.
- Do not comment on unchanged code or stylistic preferences unless they clearly affect maintainability.
