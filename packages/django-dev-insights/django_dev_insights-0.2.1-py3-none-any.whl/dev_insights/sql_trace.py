"""Runtime monkeypatch to attach tracebacks to debug SQL entries.

This patches Django's CursorDebugWrapper.execute and executemany to capture a
stack trace at the moment the SQL is executed and attach it to the last entry
in `connection.queries` as the 'traceback' key. The patch is safe (wrapped in
try/except) and only used when DEBUG + ENABLE_TRACEBACKS are enabled.
