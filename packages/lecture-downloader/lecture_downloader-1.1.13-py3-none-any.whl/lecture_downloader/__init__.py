Lecture Downloader - A comprehensive toolkit for downloading, merging, and transcribing lecture videos.

This package provides both class-based and functional APIs for processing lecture videos:

Class-based API (Primary):
    from lecture_downloader import LectureProcessor
    processor = LectureProcessor()
    results = processor.download_lectures(links, titles)

Functional API (Convenience):
    import lecture_downloader as ld
    results = ld.download_lectures(links, titles)

Features:
- Download lecture videos from Canvas
- Merge videos by module with chapter markers
- Transcribe videos using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or faster-whisper
- Automatic transcription method detection based on environment
- Flexible input handling (files, strings, lists, dicts)
- Async processing with hidden complexity
