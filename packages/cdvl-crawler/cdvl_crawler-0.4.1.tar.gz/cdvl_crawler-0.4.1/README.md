## What This Does

This package provides a unified command-line tool for working with CDVL:

**`cdvl-crawler`** with three subcommands:

- **`crawl`** - Crawls and extracts metadata from all videos and datasets on CDVL
- **`download`** - Downloads individual videos by their ID
- **`generate-site`** - Generates a searchable, interactive HTML site from crawled metadata

Features:

- **Automatic Login**: Handles authentication automatically with username/password
- **Parallel Crawling**: Concurrent requests for efficient data collection
- **Smart Enumeration**: Automatically discovers videos and datasets by ID
- **Auto-Resume**: Continues from the last crawled ID if interrupted
- **Structured Output**: JSONL format for easy data processing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars showing success/empty/failed counts
- **Download Management**: Handles large file downloads with progress indicators
- **Static Site Generator**: Creates a beautiful, searchable HTML interface for browsing videos

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An active CDVL account with username and password

## Installation

Install [with `uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
uvx cdvl-crawler --help
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --help
uvx cdvl-crawler download --help
uvx cdvl-crawler generate-site --help
```

Or install with `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install cdvl-crawler
```

Or, with pip:

```bash
pip3 install --user cdvl-crawler
```

We assume you will be using `uvx`, otherwise just run `cdvl-crawler` directly without `uvx` after installing from `pipx` or `pip`.

## Usage

Before using the tool, you need to provide your CDVL credentials. The tool supports three methods for providing credentials (in order of priority):

1. **Config file**: Create a `config.json` file in your working directory (automatically detected) or specify with `--config` that contains `username` and `password`
2. **Environment variables**: Set `CDVL_USERNAME` and `CDVL_PASSWORD`
3. **Interactive prompt**: The tool will ask for credentials if not found via other methods

**Note**: If a `config.json` file exists in your current directory, it will be automatically loaded. You don't need to specify `--config` unless you want to use a different file.

Choose the method that best suits your workflow. For example:

```bash
# Using environment variables (no config file needed)
export CDVL_USERNAME="your.email@example.com"
export CDVL_PASSWORD="your_password"
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl

# Using config.json (automatically detected if in current directory)
# Just create config.json:
# {
#   "username": "your.email@example.com",
#   "password": "your_password_here"
# }

# and run:
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl
```

### Crawling Metadata

To crawl all videos and datasets:

```bash
# Basic usage (outputs to current directory)
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl

# Save to specific directory
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --output-dir ./data

# Accept license automatically (useful for automation/scripts)
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --accept-license

# Crawl with custom concurrency and delays
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --max-concurrent 10 --delay 0.2

# Crawl up to specific ID limits
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --max-video-id 3000 --max-dataset-id 500

# Adjust failure threshold (stop after N consecutive failures)
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --max-failures 2000

# Advanced: customize ID gap probing
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --probe-step 50 --max-probe-attempts 40
```

For more options, run:

```bash
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --help
```

The crawler will automatically:

1. Log in with your credentials (from config, env vars, or prompt)
2. Crawl videos and datasets in parallel
3. Save metadata to `videos.jsonl` and `datasets.jsonl` in the output directory
4. Resume from the last ID if run again

Example output:

```
2025-10-09 15:30:03 - INFO - ✓ Login successful!
2025-10-09 15:30:03 - INFO - Starting crawlers in parallel...
Videos:   12543 | Success: 8432 | Empty: 3891 | Failed: 220
Datasets:   142 | Success:   98 | Empty:   34 | Failed:  10
```

To start fresh, delete the output files before running:

```bash
rm ./data/videos.jsonl ./data/datasets.jsonl
uvx cdvl-crawler crawl --output-dir ./data
```

To resume, just run it again - it will automatically continue from where it left off.

### Downloading Videos

Download videos by their ID:

```bash
# Download a single video (to current directory)
uvx cdvl-crawler download 42

# Download to specific directory
uvx cdvl-crawler download 42 --output-dir ./downloads

# Accept license automatically (useful for automation/scripts)
uvx cdvl-crawler download 42 --accept-license

# Download multiple videos (comma-separated)
uvx cdvl-crawler download 1,5,10,20 --output-dir ./videos

# Get download URL without downloading
uvx cdvl-crawler download 42 --dry-run

# Download to specific filename (single video only)
uvx cdvl-crawler download 42 --output my_video.avi
```

For more options:

```bash
uvx cdvl-crawler download --help
```

### Generating Static Site

After crawling metadata, you can generate a beautiful, interactive HTML site to browse the video library:

```bash
# Generate site from videos.jsonl to index.html
uvx cdvl-crawler generate-site

# Specify custom input and output files
uvx cdvl-crawler generate-site -i ./data/videos.jsonl -o ./website/index.html
```

For more options:

```bash
uvx cdvl-crawler generate-site --help
```

## Output Format

Output files use JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line).

### Video Records

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "url": "https://www.cdvl.org/members-section/view-file/?videoid=5",
  "paragraphs": [
    "Description:Pan over a children's ball pit, seen from above using a crane.",

```

Extract all titles:

```bash
jq -r '.title' videos.jsonl
```

```bash
jq 'select(.paragraphs | join(" ") | contains("codec"))' videos.jsonl
```

Convert to CSV:

```bash
jq -r '[.id, .title, .url] | @csv' videos.jsonl > videos.csv
```

## Configuration File (`config.json`)

Configuration is **optional**. The tool has sensible defaults built-in, and you can use:

- Environment variables for authentication (see [Usage](#usage) above)
- Command-line options for crawling parameters (see `--help`)
- Interactive prompts if credentials are not found

**Auto-detection**: If a file named `config.json` exists in your current directory, it will be automatically loaded. You can override this with `--config path/to/other.json`.

If you want to customize settings permanently or override defaults, create a `config.json` file:

1. Download `config.example.json` from the repository
2. Rename it to `config.json`
3. Edit `config.json` with your settings:

```json
{
  "username": "your.email@example.com",
  "password": "your_password_here",
  "endpoints": {
    "video_base_url": "https://www.cdvl.org/members-section/view-file/",
    "dataset_base_url": "https://www.cdvl.org/members-section/search"
  },
  "output": {
    "videos_file": "videos.jsonl",
    "datasets_file": "datasets.jsonl"
  },
  "start_video_id": 1,
  "start_dataset_id": 1,
  "max_video_id": null,
  "max_dataset_id": null,
  "max_concurrent_requests": 5,
  "max_consecutive_failures": 1000,
  "request_delay": 0.1,
  "probe_step": 100,
  "max_probe_attempts": 20
}
```

### Configuration Options

## API

You can also use the package programmatically:

```python
import asyncio
from cdvl_crawler import CDVLCrawler, CDVLDownloader, CDVLSiteGenerator

# Crawl videos and datasets
async def crawl():
    # Config file is optional - will use env vars or prompt
    crawler = CDVLCrawler(config_path=None, output_dir="./data")
    await crawler.crawl()

# Download a specific video
async def download():
    # Config file is optional - will use env vars or prompt
    downloader = CDVLDownloader(config_path=None, output_dir="./downloads")
    await downloader._init_session()
    await downloader._login()

    url = await downloader.get_download_link(42)
    if url:
        await downloader.download_file(url, "output.avi")

    await downloader._close_session()

# Generate static site
def generate_site():
    generator = CDVLSiteGenerator(
        input_file="./data/videos.jsonl",
        output_file="./website/index.html"
    )
    success = generator.generate()
    print(f"Site generated: {success}")

# Run
asyncio.run(crawl())
asyncio.run(download())
generate_site()
```
