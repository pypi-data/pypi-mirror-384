        Uploads a File to an existing Dataset.
        The body of the request must contain the binary content of the file and the `Content-Type` header must be `application/octet-stream`.

        #### Advanced Usage
        See [Datasets Core Concepts](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/datasets/) for details on using branches and transactions.
        To **upload a file to a specific Branch** specify the Branch's name as `branchName`. A new transaction will
        be created and committed on this branch. By default the TransactionType will be `UPDATE`, to override this
        default specify `transactionType` in addition to `branchName`.
        See [createBranch](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/api/datasets-resources/branches/create-branch/) to create a custom branch.
        To **upload a file on a manually opened transaction** specify the Transaction's resource identifier as
        `transactionRid`. This is useful for uploading multiple files in a single transaction.
        See [createTransaction](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/api/datasets-resources/transactions/create-transaction/) to open a transaction.
