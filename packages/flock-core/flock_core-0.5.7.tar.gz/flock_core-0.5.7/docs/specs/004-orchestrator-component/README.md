# OrchestratorComponent Implementation (Spec 004)

## 🚀 Quick Start

**You're on branch `feat/logging-orchestrator` - Ready to implement!**

### What to Read (In Order)

1. **START HERE**: [`UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
   - Single comprehensive guide
   - Architecture + Logging integrated
   - Phase-by-phase with copy-paste code
   - Tests → Implementation → Logging → Validate pattern

2. **Quick Reference**: [`../../../internal/system-improvements/LOGGING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](../../internal/system-improvements/LOGGING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
   - Logging patterns cheat sheet
   - Keep this open while coding

3. **Design Spec** (background reading): [`../../internal/system-improvements/orchestrator-component-design.md`](../../internal/system-improvements/orchestrator-component-design.md)
   - Complete architectural rationale
   - Hook design details

### Implementation Timeline

**Week 1**: Phases 1-5 (Foundation → CircuitBreaker)  
**Week 2**: Phases 6-7 (Deduplication → Integration + All tests passing)

**Total Effort**: 40-60 hours

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 138-line `_schedule_artifact` reduced to <50 lines
- [ ] All 743 existing tests passing
- [ ] CircuitBreaker and Deduplication components working
- [ ] Comprehensive logging at all phases
- [ ] Performance overhead <5%
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved

## 🎯 What This Achieves

### Architecture Improvement
- ✅ Clean orchestrator (100+ line method → <50 lines)
- ✅ Pluggable components (add features without core changes)
- ✅ Testable units (component isolation)
- ✅ Backward compatible (zero breaking changes)

### Observability Improvement
- ✅ Component lifecycle logging
- ✅ Scheduling decision logging
- ✅ Hook execution logging
- ✅ Structured format (grep-friendly)
- ✅ Production debugging enabled

## 🏃 Next Steps

1. **Open** `UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. **Read** Context Priming section
3. **Start** Phase 1 (Base Classes and Enums)
4. **Follow** the TDD pattern: Tests → Implement → Validate → Commit

Each phase includes:
- Context reading checklist
- Complete test code (copy-paste)
- Complete implementation code (copy-paste)
- Logging code (integrated)
- Validation commands
- Commit message template

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Don't skip tests**: They're already written - just copy them
- **Commit after each phase**: Create checkpoints for safety
- **Run existing tests frequently**: Catch regressions early
- **Use logging quick reference**: Save time on formatting
- **Ask questions**: Better to clarify than assume
