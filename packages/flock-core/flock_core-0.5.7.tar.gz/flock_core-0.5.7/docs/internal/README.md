## Why Internal?

These documents are valuable for:
- **Contributors** - Understanding architecture and patterns
- **Researchers** - Academic analysis and papers
- **Maintainers** - Design decisions and roadmap
- **AI Agents** - Development context

But they're **not end-user documentation** suitable for the public mkdocs site.
