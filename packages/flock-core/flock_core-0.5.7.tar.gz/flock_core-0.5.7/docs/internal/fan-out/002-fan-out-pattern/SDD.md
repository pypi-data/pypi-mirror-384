## Solution Strategy

- Architecture Pattern: Component-based plugin architecture with lifecycle hooks
- Integration Approach: FanOutComponent intercepts post_evaluate to transform artifacts
- Justification: Maintains separation of concerns, engine stays pure, orchestrator unmodified
- Key Decisions: Explicit .fan_out() for clarity, runtime mode detection for parallel streaming

## Building Block View

    FanOutComponent --> |post_evaluate| EvalResult
    EvalResult --> |expanded artifacts| Orchestrator

### Interface Specifications

#### Data Storage Changes

No database schema changes required.

#### Internal API Changes

```yaml
# Python API Extension
Method: AgentBuilder.fan_out()
  Parameters:
    list_field: str = "items"
    preserve_correlation: bool = True
    max_items: Optional[int] = None
  Returns: Self (for chaining)

# WebSocket Event Extensions
Event: message_published
  Additional Fields:
    is_fan_out_parent: boolean
    fan_out_count: number
    parent_artifact_id: string
    sequence_index: number
```

## Runtime View

### Primary Flow

#### Primary Flow: Fan-Out Execution
1. User adds `.fan_out()` to agent builder
2. Agent publishes artifact with list field
3. FanOutComponent intercepts in post_evaluate hook
4. Component expands list into individual artifacts
5. Orchestrator publishes each artifact separately
6. Downstream agents process items in parallel
7. Dashboard visualizes parallel execution

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Developer
    participant Agent
    participant FanOutComponent
    participant Orchestrator
    participant Blackboard
    participant DownstreamAgent

    Developer->>Agent: .fan_out() configuration
    Agent->>FanOutComponent: EvalResult with list
    FanOutComponent->>FanOutComponent: Expand list to items
    FanOutComponent->>Agent: Modified EvalResult
    Agent->>Orchestrator: Publish artifacts
    loop For each artifact
        Orchestrator->>Blackboard: Store artifact
        Blackboard->>DownstreamAgent: Schedule processing
    end
```

### Error Handling
- Empty list: No artifacts published (intentional no-op)
- Missing field: Pass through unchanged, log warning
- Memory limit: Apply max_items cap, log truncation

## Deployment View

No change to existing deployment - feature is opt-in via `.fan_out()` method.

## Cross-Cutting Concepts

### Pattern Documentation

```yaml
# Existing patterns used
- pattern: docs/patterns/component-architecture.md
  relevance: CRITICAL
  why: "Base pattern for FanOutComponent implementation"

# New patterns created
- pattern: docs/patterns/fan-out-pattern.md
  relevance: CRITICAL
  why: "Core fan-out pattern documentation"
```

### System-Wide Patterns

- Security: Maintain artifact visibility and correlation IDs
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation, log warnings for edge cases
- Performance: Lazy creation, batch events for large fan-outs
- Logging/Auditing: Track fan-out operations with metrics

### Implementation Patterns

See `/docs/patterns/fanout-implementation-guide.md` for complete code patterns.

## Architecture Decisions

- [x] **Component-based approach**: Use AgentComponent for fan-out
  - Rationale: Clean separation, reusable, pluggable
  - Trade-offs: Requires understanding component lifecycle
  - User confirmed: ✓

- [x] **Explicit .fan_out() method**: Require explicit opt-in
  - Rationale: Clear intent, no surprises, discoverable
  - Trade-offs: Not automatic, requires code change
  - User confirmed: ✓

- [x] **Runtime mode detection**: Enable parallel streaming in dashboard
  - Rationale: Remove artificial limitation, better UX
  - Trade-offs: Added complexity in Context
  - User confirmed: ✓

## Quality Requirements

- Performance: <10ms overhead for small fan-outs, <500ms for large (1000 items)
- Usability: Discoverable via IDE autocomplete, clear documentation
- Security: Respect visibility, rate limit events (100/sec)
- Reliability: Graceful edge case handling, no data loss

## Risks and Technical Debt

### Known Technical Issues

- Current streaming limitation is artificial (CLI-only constraint)
- WebSocket may need backpressure for very large fan-outs

### Technical Debt

- Single stream limitation should be removed for dashboard
- Consider batch artifact creation for performance

### Implementation Gotchas

- Rich Live conflicts prevent multiple CLI streams
- Correlation ID preservation critical for tracking
- Memory usage scales with fan-out size

## Test Specifications

### Critical Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Basic Fan-Out**
```gherkin
Given: Agent configured with .fan_out(list_field="items")
When: Agent publishes artifact with items=["a", "b", "c"]
Then: Three individual artifacts created
And: Each has parent correlation ID
And: Each has sequence metadata
```

**Scenario 2: Edge Cases**
```gherkin
Given: Agent with fan-out enabled
When: Empty list published
Then: No artifacts created
And: No errors raised
```

**Scenario 3: Parallel Streaming**
```gherkin
Given: Dashboard mode active
When: Multiple agents stream simultaneously
Then: All streams display in parallel
And: No stream conflicts occur
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Business Logic**: Fan-out expansion logic, metadata preservation
- **Integration Points**: Component hooks, WebSocket events
- **Edge Cases**: Empty lists, missing fields, max_items limits
- **Performance**: Large fan-outs, memory usage
