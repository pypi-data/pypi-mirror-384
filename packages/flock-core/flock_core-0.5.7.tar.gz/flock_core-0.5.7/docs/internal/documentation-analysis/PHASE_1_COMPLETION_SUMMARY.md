## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Broken Links (REQUIRED)
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** Unblocks strict builds, enables CI/CD

1. Fix file name references (AUTO_TRACING → auto-tracing)
2. Fix path references (tracing-quickstart → tracing/tracing-quickstart)
3. Remove/fix links to AGENTS.md and src/ (not user-facing)
4. Verify: `mkdocs build --strict` passes

### Priority 2: Add Section Index Pages (RECOMMENDED)
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Impact:** Better navigation UX

1. Create getting-started/index.md (overview + cards to subpages)
2. Create guides/index.md (guide categories + cards)
3. Create reference/index.md (API + config links)
4. Optional: concepts/index.md, examples/index.md, community/index.md

### Priority 3: Add Tags & Metadata (OPTIONAL)
**Effort:** 3 hours
**Impact:** Improved searchability & SEO

1. Configure tags plugin in mkdocs.yml
2. Add front matter to all pages (tags, description, time estimates)
3. Create tags index page
4. Add difficulty badges to tutorials

### Priority 4: Configure Social Cards (OPTIONAL)
**Effort:** 1 hour
**Impact:** Better social media sharing

1. Install/configure social plugin
2. Design card template
3. Test card generation

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action
**Fix the 13 broken links** - This is blocking strict builds and will cause issues in CI/CD pipelines.

### Short Term (This Week)
**Add section index pages** - These provide better navigation and are expected in Material theme with navigation.indexes enabled.

### Medium Term (Next Week)
**Add tags and metadata** - Enhances discoverability but not critical for functionality.

### Long Term (Phase 2)
- API auto-generation (mkdocstrings)
- Example gallery pages
- Community pages
- Social cards

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has delivered a **high-quality documentation foundation** with:
- ✅ Professional design matching dashboard
- ✅ Excellent user experience features
- ✅ Comprehensive content covering all core features
- ✅ Modern MkDocs configuration

The documentation is **production-ready for viewing** but needs **link fixes for CI/CD**.

**Status:** ✅ **Phase 1 SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE** (with minor cleanup needed)
