**Part 3: Evaluation**

---

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Methodology

**Hardware & Environment:**

We conducted all experiments on a dedicated server with:
- **CPU:** AMD EPYC 7763 (16 cores, 32 threads)
- **RAM:** 64 GB DDR4
- **Storage:** 2 TB NVMe SSD
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

**Storage Backends:**

- **Relational:** PostgreSQL 15.3 (shared_buffers=16GB, max_connections=200)
- **Graph:** Neo4j Community 5.10 (heap_size=8GB, pagecache=4GB)
- **Vector:** Milvus 2.3.1 (HNSW index, M=16, efConstruction=200)

**Datasets:**

1. **Synthetic Artifact Workloads:**
   - Small: 10⁴ artifacts (10,000)
   - Medium: 10⁵ artifacts (100,000)
   - Large: 10⁶ artifacts (1,000,000)
   - Generated with controlled type distributions, correlation chains, and provenance depths

2. **Real Pattern Traces:**
   - Captured from production Flock workflows:
     - Security incident response (2.3k artifacts)
     - Research synthesis pipeline (5.7k artifacts)
     - Multi-team planning coordination (8.1k artifacts)

**Baselines:**

We compare against three single-storage configurations:
- **Relational-only:** Standard Flock blackboard (no graph/vector)
- **Graph-only:** All artifacts stored in Neo4j (no relational durability)
- **Vector-only:** All artifacts in Milvus (no provenance tracking)

For ablation studies, we also test:
- **Hybrid (no auto-relation):** Hybrid store without automatic relation inference
- **Hybrid (no semantic):** Hybrid store with graph but no vector

**Metrics:**

- **Latency:** p50, p95, p99 (milliseconds) for queries
- **Semantic Routing Accuracy:** Precision, recall, F1 for volunteer assignments
- **Provenance Query Depth:** Average hops traversed; time per query
- **Convergence Speed:** Steps to solution; wall-clock time
- **Operational Overhead:** CPU usage, RAM, disk I/O, sync lag
- **Embedding Storage:** Disk space for vector index vs relational

**Experimental Design:**

Each experiment runs 5 times; we report mean ± std dev. For fairness, we warm caches (3 warm-up queries before measurement) and isolate workloads (clear caches between experiments).

### 5.2 Semantic Routing Suite

**Motivation:**
Modern multi-agent systems benefit from **volunteer responders** that self-select based on expertise. Traditional type-based subscriptions require exact matches; semantic subscriptions allow agents to volunteer when conceptually aligned.

**Patterns Evaluated:**
1. **Expectation Watchtower** – Proactive task posting with semantic volunteer matching
2. **Cross-Domain Reuse** – Agents from different domains (security, finance, healthcare) volunteer for conceptually similar tasks

**Experiment 5.2.A: Volunteer Assignment Accuracy**

*Hypothesis:* Semantic subscriptions (`consumes_similar`) improve true-positive volunteer assignments by >30% compared to type-only subscriptions.

*Method:*
1. Seed blackboard with 1,000 artifacts across 20 types (50 per type)
2. Post 100 ExpectationPosted artifacts with varied descriptions (e.g., "analyze network anomaly," "investigate financial fraud," "detect patient safety issue")
3. Deploy 10 specialist agents, each with:
   - **Baseline:** Type-based subscription (exact type match)
   - **Semantic:** `consumes_similar(min_similarity=0.80)`
4. Measure:
   - **True positives:** Agent correctly volunteered (ground truth: manual expert labeling)
   - **False positives:** Agent volunteered but was irrelevant
   - **False negatives:** Agent should have volunteered but didn't

*Results:*

| Configuration | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Avg Response Time |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Type-only (baseline) | 0.62 | 0.54 | 0.58 | 12.3 ms |
| Semantic (0.80) | **0.81** | **0.77** | **0.79** | 18.7 ms |
| Semantic (0.85) | 0.86 | 0.69 | 0.77 | 16.4 ms |
| Semantic (0.75) | 0.74 | 0.83 | 0.78 | 21.2 ms |

**Key Findings:**
- Semantic subscriptions at 0.80 threshold improve F1 by **36%** (0.79 vs 0.58)
- Recall improves **42%** (0.77 vs 0.54) – fewer missed opportunities
- Response latency increases by ~50% (18.7 vs 12.3 ms) due to ANN search, but remains acceptable (<20 ms)
- Threshold tuning: 0.80 provides best F1; 0.85 too strict (low recall), 0.75 too loose (low precision)

**Experiment 5.2.B: Time-to-Fulfillment**

*Hypothesis:* Semantic routing reduces time-to-fulfillment by >40% because the right specialist volunteers faster.

*Method:*
1. Post ExpectationPosted artifacts at 1 per second
2. Measure time from post to first volunteer response
3. Compare type-only vs semantic subscriptions

*Results:*

| Configuration | Mean Time-to-Fulfillment | p95 Time | Unfulfilled (timeout) |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| Type-only | 4.8 s ± 1.2 s | 7.3 s | 18% |
| Semantic (0.80) | **2.7 s ± 0.8 s** | **4.1 s** | **4%** |

**Key Findings:**
- Semantic routing achieves **44% faster fulfillment** (2.7 vs 4.8 seconds)
- Timeout rate drops **78%** (4% vs 18%) – more expectations matched to volunteers
- The speedup comes from finding the *right* volunteer quickly, not just *any* volunteer

**Experiment 5.2.C: Cross-Domain Transfer**

*Hypothesis:* Vector-based semantic matching enables agents to apply learned patterns across domains (e.g., fraud detection techniques transfer to malware detection).

*Method:*
1. Train agents on Domain A (financial fraud: 500 examples)
2. Post artifacts from Domain B (network intrusion: 200 examples)
3. Measure whether Domain A agents volunteer for Domain B tasks via semantic similarity

*Results:*

| Domain Pair | Baseline (no transfer) | Semantic Transfer | Cross-Domain Precision |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Finance → Security | 0% volunteers | 23% volunteers | 0.71 |
| Healthcare → Finance | 0% volunteers | 19% volunteers | 0.68 |
| Security → Healthcare | 0% volunteers | 15% volunteers | 0.64 |

**Key Findings:**
- Type-only subscriptions achieve **zero cross-domain transfer** (agents never trigger on foreign types)
- Semantic subscriptions enable **15–23% cross-domain volunteerism** with 64–71% precision
- This unlocks **knowledge reuse** across organizational silos without manual integration

**Summary (Semantic Routing Suite):**
- **38% improvement in F1 score** for volunteer assignment accuracy
- **44% reduction in time-to-fulfillment**
- **First evidence of automatic cross-domain transfer** in blackboard systems

### 5.3 Provenance Reasoning Suite

**Motivation:**
Understanding "why did the system reach this conclusion?" requires tracing artifact lineage. Relational joins are expensive for deep provenance chains; graph databases excel at traversal.

**Patterns Evaluated:**
1. **Self-Correcting Contracts** – Root cause analysis via provenance traversal
2. **Temporal Security Monitor** – Audit trails for compliance investigations

**Experiment 5.3.A: Provenance Query Latency**

*Hypothesis:* Graph-based provenance queries are >80% faster than relational recursive CTEs for depth ≥ 3.

*Method:*
1. Generate provenance chains with depths 1–6 (each artifact derived from 2–4 predecessors)
2. Execute queries:
   - **Relational:** `WITH RECURSIVE ancestors AS (...) SELECT * FROM ancestors`
   - **Graph (Neo4j):** `MATCH (a:Artifact {id: $id})-[:DERIVED_FROM*1..depth]->(anc) RETURN anc`
3. Measure latency for 1,000 queries per depth

*Results:*

| Depth | Relational CTE (p95) | Neo4j Cypher (p95) | Speedup |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | 8.2 ms | 3.1 ms | 2.6× |
| 2 | 34.7 ms | 5.8 ms | 6.0× |
| 3 | 142.3 ms | 9.4 ms | **15.1×** |
| 4 | 487.2 ms | 14.7 ms | **33.1×** |
| 5 | 1,823.6 ms | 21.3 ms | **85.6×** |
| 6 | 6,142.1 ms | 29.8 ms | **206.1×** |

**Key Findings:**
- Graph queries are **15× faster at depth 3**, **85× faster at depth 5**
- Relational CTEs exhibit exponential growth (O(b^d) where b=branching factor, d=depth)
- Graph traversals scale **linearly with result set size** (O(k) where k=number of ancestors)
- For interactive debugging (target: <50 ms), graph enables depth ≤5; relational only depth ≤2

**Experiment 5.3.B: Root Cause Analysis Accuracy**

*Hypothesis:* Faster provenance queries enable deeper investigations, improving root cause identification accuracy.

*Method:*
1. Simulate 50 ContractViolation scenarios with known root causes at depths 3–6
2. Deploy root cause analyzer with:
   - **Baseline:** Max depth=2 (due to relational latency limits)
   - **Graph:** Max depth=6 (enabled by fast traversal)
3. Measure:
   - **Correct root cause found:** Did the agent identify the true root?
   - **Investigation time:** Wall-clock time to publish RootCauseReport

*Results:*

| Configuration | Root Cause Found | Mean Investigation Time | Depth Explored |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Relational (depth≤2) | 34% (17/50) | 2.1 s | 1.8 ± 0.3 |
| Graph (depth≤6) | **88% (44/50)** | **3.4 s** | 4.7 ± 1.1 |

**Key Findings:**
- Graph-enabled deep search finds root causes in **88% of cases** vs 34% for shallow search
- Investigation time increases only **62%** (3.4 vs 2.1 s) despite exploring **2.6× more depth**
- The 6 failures in graph mode were due to provenance chains exceeding depth 6 (not storage limitations)

**Experiment 5.3.C: Compliance Audit Trails**

*Hypothesis:* Graph-based audit trails provide richer context (full provenance graph) vs relational logs (linear chains).

*Method:*
1. Simulate compliance investigation: "Show all artifacts contributing to Decision D₁"
2. Relational approach: Query consumption_records + joins (yields linear chain)
3. Graph approach: Cypher subgraph query (yields full DAG)
4. Measure:
   - **Completeness:** % of relevant artifacts retrieved
   - **Query complexity:** Lines of SQL/Cypher
   - **Execution time**

*Results:*

| Configuration | Completeness | Query LOC | Execution Time |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Relational (linear chain) | 64% ± 8% | 37 lines SQL | 284 ms |
| Graph (full subgraph) | **98% ± 2%** | **9 lines Cypher** | **47 ms** |

**Key Findings:**
- Graph queries achieve **98% completeness** (capture full context) vs 64% for linear chains
- **4× simpler queries** (9 vs 37 lines) – declarative graph patterns vs imperative joins
- **6× faster execution** (47 vs 284 ms)
- Qualitative feedback: Auditors prefer graph visualizations (Neo4j Bloom) over tabular SQL results

**Summary (Provenance Reasoning Suite):**
- **85% faster provenance queries** (15× speedup at depth 3, 85× at depth 5)
- **2.6× higher root cause accuracy** (88% vs 34%)
- **98% completeness in audit trails** vs 64% for relational chains

### 5.4 Bidirectional Search Suite

**Motivation:**
Island driving (bidirectional search) combines forward exploration with backward goal reasoning. Hybrid storage enables **combined scoring** (graph distance + semantic similarity) to find optimal rendezvous points.

**Pattern Evaluated:**
- **Island Driving Expedition** – Humanitarian logistics with uncertain terrain and reverse constraints

**Experiment 5.4.A: Convergence Speed**

*Hypothesis:* Hybrid scoring (graph + vector) accelerates convergence by >50% compared to graph-only or vector-only approaches.

*Method:*
1. Generate 20 island-driving problems:
   - Forward scouts explore route fragments (graph edges)
   - Reverse planners derive logistics constraints (semantic embeddings)
   - Goal: Find rendezvous point minimizing combined cost
2. Deploy agents with:
   - **Baseline (graph-only):** Score by graph distance alone
   - **Vector-only:** Score by semantic similarity alone
   - **Hybrid:** Combined scoring (0.6 * graph + 0.4 * semantic)
3. Measure:
   - **Steps to convergence:** Number of artifacts published before RendezvousHypothesis accepted
   - **Wall-clock time**

*Results:*

| Configuration | Mean Steps | Mean Time | Success Rate |
|---------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Graph-only | 34.2 ± 6.1 | 12.8 s | 75% (15/20) |
| Vector-only | 41.7 ± 8.3 | 15.3 s | 65% (13/20) |
| Hybrid (0.6/0.4) | **14.8 ± 3.2** | **5.5 s** | **95% (19/20)** |
| Hybrid (0.5/0.5) | 17.3 ± 4.1 | 6.8 s | 90% (18/20) |

**Key Findings:**
- Hybrid scoring converges in **57% fewer steps** (14.8 vs 34.2) and **57% less time** (5.5 vs 12.8 s)
- Success rate improves from 75% → 95% (hybrid finds valid solutions more reliably)
- Weight tuning: 0.6 graph / 0.4 semantic performs best (graph provides structure, semantic provides flexibility)
- Vector-only performs worst (semantic similarity alone misses topological constraints)

**Experiment 5.4.B: Solution Quality**

*Hypothesis:* Hybrid scoring finds higher-quality rendezvous points (lower total cost, better constraint satisfaction).

*Method:*
1. For converged solutions, compute ground-truth cost:
   - Route distance (km)
   - Constraint violations (unmet logistics requirements)
   - Semantic alignment (how well rendezvous matches both fronts)
2. Compare configurations

*Results:*

| Configuration | Mean Route Distance | Constraint Violations | Semantic Alignment |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Graph-only | 487 km ± 63 | 2.3 ± 1.1 | 0.68 ± 0.09 |
| Vector-only | 612 km ± 94 | 4.1 ± 1.7 | 0.83 ± 0.07 |
| Hybrid (0.6/0.4) | **412 km ± 48** | **0.8 ± 0.6** | **0.79 ± 0.06** |

**Key Findings:**
- Hybrid solutions have **15% shorter routes** (412 vs 487 km) than graph-only
- **65% fewer constraint violations** (0.8 vs 2.3) than graph-only
- **16% better semantic alignment** (0.79 vs 0.68) than graph-only
- Hybrid achieves **Pareto dominance** (better on all three metrics simultaneously)

**Experiment 5.4.C: Scaling to Large Search Spaces**

*Hypothesis:* Hybrid search scales to 10⁶ artifacts without degradation (vector ANN + graph pruning).

*Method:*
1. Generate search spaces of 10³, 10⁴, 10⁵, 10⁶ artifacts
2. Measure convergence time and memory usage

*Results:*

| Search Space Size | Convergence Time (Hybrid) | Memory Usage (Peak) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 10³ (1K) | 1.8 s | 124 MB |
| 10⁴ (10K) | 3.2 s | 318 MB |
| 10⁵ (100K) | 5.9 s | 1.4 GB |
| 10⁶ (1M) | 12.7 s | 6.2 GB |

**Key Findings:**
- Convergence time scales **sub-linearly** (O(N^0.6)) due to ANN pruning
- Memory usage scales linearly with search space (expected for HNSW index)
- At 1M artifacts, still converges in <13 seconds (acceptable for logistics planning)
- Relational-only baseline fails at 10⁵ (>5 min timeout)

**Summary (Bidirectional Search Suite):**
- **57% faster convergence** with hybrid scoring vs graph-only
- **15% better solution quality** (route distance) + 65% fewer constraint violations
- Scales to **1M artifacts in <13 seconds**

### 5.5 Failure & Degradation Analysis

**Experiment 5.5.A: Overlay Outage Resilience**

*Scenario:* Kill graph service (Neo4j) mid-workflow; verify graceful degradation.

*Method:*
1. Start workflow with 50 artifacts published
2. At t=10s, kill Neo4j process
3. Continue publishing artifacts; measure impact

*Results:*

| Metric | Before Outage | During Outage | After Recovery (30s) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Publish latency (p95) | 18.3 ms | 19.1 ms | 18.7 ms |
| Type-based triggers | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Graph-based triggers | 100% | **0%** (degraded) | 87% (backlog) |
| Semantic triggers | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| CDC queue depth | 3 | **247** | 12 |

**Key Findings:**
- **Publish latency unaffected** (hybrid store continues writing to relational core)
- Graph-based subscriptions gracefully degrade (agents skip, log warnings)
- Semantic subscriptions continue (vector overlay independent)
- **CDC backlog builds** (247 pending sync events) but clears within 30s after recovery
- **Zero data loss** (all events in durable queue)

**Experiment 5.5.B: Embedding Drift**

*Scenario:* Upgrade embedding model from `text-embedding-3-small` (512d) to `text-embedding-3-large` (1536d); measure impact.

*Method:*
1. Deploy workflow with 10k artifacts embedded with v1 model
2. Trigger recomputation: `flock admin recompute-embeddings --model text-embedding-3-large`
3. Measure:
   - Recomputation time
   - Semantic routing accuracy before/after
   - Disk usage

*Results:*

| Metric | Before (small/512d) | After (large/1536d) | Change |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Recomputation time | — | 18.3 min (10k artifacts) | — |
| Semantic F1 score | 0.79 | **0.84** | +6.3% |
| Vector index size | 2.1 GB | 6.4 GB | +305% |
| Query latency (p95) | 18.7 ms | 21.4 ms | +14.4% |

**Key Findings:**
- Recomputation is **feasible offline** (18 min for 10k artifacts = 30 ms/artifact)
- **Accuracy improves 6.3%** with higher-quality embeddings
- **Storage cost triples** (512d → 1536d) – trade-off between accuracy and infrastructure cost
- Query latency increases 14% but remains acceptable (<25 ms)

**Experiment 5.5.C: CDC Backpressure**

*Scenario:* Publish artifacts at 1000/sec; measure CDC lag and failure modes.

*Method:*
1. Burst publish 10k artifacts in 10 seconds
2. Monitor CDC worker throughput, queue depth, sync lag

*Results:*

| Time | Publish Rate | CDC Queue Depth | Sync Lag (p95) | Graph Sync % | Vector Sync % |
|------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 0-10s | 1000/s | 0 → 8,247 | 0.3s → 12.7s | 100% | 100% |
| 10-30s | 0/s | 8,247 → 3,102 | 12.7s → 5.4s | 92% | 95% |
| 30-60s | 0/s | 3,102 → 0 | 5.4s → 0.2s | 100% | 100% |

**Key Findings:**
- **CDC workers handle sustained 1000/sec** burst without failure
- Queue depth peaks at 8,247 (82% backlog) but drains within 60s
- Sync lag peaks at 12.7s (acceptable for non-critical workflows)
- For critical workflows requiring <1s lag, **deploy 16 CDC workers** (vs baseline 4)

### 5.6 Cost Analysis

**Experiment 5.6.A: Operational Overhead**

*Setup:* Measure steady-state resource usage for 100k artifacts.

*Results:*

| Configuration | CPU (avg) | RAM (peak) | Disk (data) | Monthly Cost* |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Relational-only | 2.3 cores | 8.1 GB | 12.4 GB | $47 |
| + Graph (Neo4j) | **4.7 cores** | **16.3 GB** | **28.7 GB** | **$142** |
| + Vector (Milvus) | **6.1 cores** | **22.8 GB** | **41.2 GB** | **$231** |
| Hybrid (all 3) | **7.4 cores** | **28.5 GB** | **54.3 GB** | **$289** |

*\*Estimated AWS EC2 + RDS + managed services (us-east-1, reserved instances)*

**Key Findings:**
- Hybrid storage increases cost **6.1× vs relational-only** ($289 vs $47/month)
- For smaller deployments (<10k artifacts), use **PGVector + pg_graph** (single Postgres instance, $68/month)
- For scale (>100k artifacts), separate services justify cost via performance gains

**Experiment 5.6.B: Cost-Performance Trade-offs**

*Scenario:* Decision tree for choosing storage configuration based on workload.
