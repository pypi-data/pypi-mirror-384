## üéØ Key Question Answered

**Question**: When an agent produces an artifact from correlated inputs (JoinSpec), which correlation_id does it get?

**Answer**: The correlation_id from the **FIRST** input artifact.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Summary

### Issue: Lost Data Lineage

**Problem**: When radiologist agent correlates XRayImage + LabResults:
- DiagnosticReport gets correlation_id from XRayImage (first)
- LabResults correlation_id is NOT preserved
- Cannot trace outputs back to ALL inputs

**Impact**: Debugging, audit trails, and data provenance queries are incomplete

## üí° Recommendations

| Recommendation | Priority | Issue Solved |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Add parent_artifact_ids field** | HIGH | Track ALL input artifacts |
| **Rename correlation_id ‚Üí trace_id** | MEDIUM | Reduce terminology confusion |
| **Add lineage query helpers** | MEDIUM | Improve developer experience |
| **Document the distinction** | HIGH | Education and clarity |
