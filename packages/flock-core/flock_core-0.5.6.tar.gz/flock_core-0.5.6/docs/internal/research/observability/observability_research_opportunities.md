## 1. Novel Debugging Capabilities Unique to Flock

### 1.1 Causal Artifact Lineage Tracing

**What makes this unique:** Unlike graph-based frameworks where you verify predefined paths, Flock enables **discovery of emergent causality chains** in blackboard systems.

**Capability:** Reconstruct which artifact caused which agent execution, spanning multiple cascades.

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Trace complete artifact lineage through multi-agent cascade
WITH RECURSIVE artifact_lineage AS (
    -- Base case: Initial artifact published by external
    SELECT
        span_id,
        json_extract(attributes, '$.output.type') as artifact_type,
        json_extract(attributes, '$.output.value') as artifact_value,
        service as producer_agent,
        trace_id,
        0 as depth
    FROM spans
    WHERE name = 'Flock.publish'
    AND json_extract(attributes, '$.producer') = 'external'

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: Artifacts produced by agents consuming previous artifacts
    SELECT
        s.span_id,
        json_extract(s.attributes, '$.output.type'),
        json_extract(s.attributes, '$.output.value'),
        s.service,
        s.trace_id,
        al.depth + 1
    FROM spans s
    JOIN artifact_lineage al ON (
        s.trace_id = al.trace_id AND
        json_extract(s.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].type') = al.artifact_type AND
        s.start_time > (SELECT end_time FROM spans WHERE span_id = al.span_id)
    )
    WHERE s.name = 'Agent.execute'
)
SELECT
    depth,
    artifact_type,
    producer_agent,
    json_extract(artifact_value, '$.title') as artifact_title,
    '→' as flow_indicator
FROM artifact_lineage
ORDER BY depth, producer_agent;
```

**Research Question:** Can we automatically infer agent intent by analyzing artifact transformation patterns? For example, detecting if an agent consistently modifies artifacts in ways inconsistent with its declared purpose.

**Why this is novel:**
- LangGraph/CrewAI trace predefined edges (verify what you planned)
- Flock traces emergent causality (discover what actually happened)
- Enables post-hoc workflow mining from execution traces

**Practical Application:** Root cause analysis for "why did this agent unexpectedly execute?"

---

### 1.2 Performance Bottleneck Detection with Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**What makes this unique:** DuckDB's columnar storage enables correlating latency with input characteristics at scale.

**Capability:** Identify which input features cause slowness using statistical analysis impossible with traditional logs.

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Correlate input payload size with agent execution time
SELECT
    service as agent,
    CASE
        WHEN LENGTH(json_extract(attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0]')) < 1000 THEN 'small'
        WHEN LENGTH(json_extract(attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0]')) < 10000 THEN 'medium'
        ELSE 'large'
    END as input_size,
    COUNT(*) as execution_count,
    AVG(duration_ms) as avg_latency_ms,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) as p95_latency_ms,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) as p99_latency_ms,
    MAX(duration_ms) as max_latency_ms
FROM spans
WHERE name LIKE '%Agent.execute'
AND start_time > (EPOCH(NOW()) - 86400) * 1000000  -- Last 24 hours
GROUP BY service, input_size
ORDER BY agent, avg_latency_ms DESC;
```

**Advanced: Detect Non-Linear Latency Growth**
```sql
-- Identify agents where latency growth is non-linear (O(n²) or worse)
WITH input_complexity AS (
    SELECT
        service,
        json_array_length(json_extract(attributes, '$.input.artifacts')) as num_artifacts,
        duration_ms,
        span_id
    FROM spans
    WHERE name LIKE '%Agent.execute'
)
SELECT
    service,
    num_artifacts,
    AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration,
    -- Ratio of current to previous complexity level
    AVG(duration_ms) / LAG(AVG(duration_ms)) OVER (PARTITION BY service ORDER BY num_artifacts) as growth_ratio
FROM input_complexity
GROUP BY service, num_artifacts
HAVING num_artifacts > 0
ORDER BY service, num_artifacts;
```

**Research Question:** Can we automatically detect algorithmic complexity issues (O(n²) behaviors) by analyzing latency patterns across varying input sizes?

**Why this is novel:**
- Most frameworks track latency but don't correlate with input characteristics
- Requires both timing data AND full I/O capture
- Enables automatic performance regression detection

---

### 1.3 Anomaly Detection via Behavioral Pattern Mining

**What makes this unique:** Complete execution history enables statistical anomaly detection without predefined rules.

**Capability:** Detect unusual agent behaviors by comparing current execution to historical baselines.

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Detect statistical anomalies in agent execution patterns
WITH agent_baselines AS (
    SELECT
        service,
        operation,
        AVG(duration_ms) as baseline_avg_ms,
        STDDEV(duration_ms) as baseline_stddev_ms,
        AVG(json_array_length(json_extract(attributes, '$.input.artifacts'))) as baseline_input_count
    FROM spans
    WHERE start_time < (EPOCH(NOW()) - 3600) * 1000000  -- Baseline: everything before last hour
    AND name LIKE '%Agent.execute'
    GROUP BY service, operation
),
recent_executions AS (
    SELECT
        span_id,
        service,
        operation,
        duration_ms,
        json_array_length(json_extract(attributes, '$.input.artifacts')) as input_count,
        start_time
    FROM spans
    WHERE start_time >= (EPOCH(NOW()) - 3600) * 1000000  -- Last hour
    AND name LIKE '%Agent.execute'
)
SELECT
    re.span_id,
    re.service,
    re.operation,
    re.duration_ms as actual_duration_ms,
    ab.baseline_avg_ms,
    -- Z-score: How many standard deviations from baseline?
    (re.duration_ms - ab.baseline_avg_ms) / NULLIF(ab.baseline_stddev_ms, 0) as latency_z_score,
    re.input_count as actual_input_count,
    ab.baseline_input_count,
    CASE
        WHEN ABS((re.duration_ms - ab.baseline_avg_ms) / NULLIF(ab.baseline_stddev_ms, 0)) > 3 THEN 'ANOMALY'
        WHEN ABS((re.duration_ms - ab.baseline_avg_ms) / NULLIF(ab.baseline_stddev_ms, 0)) > 2 THEN 'WARNING'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as status
FROM recent_executions re
JOIN agent_baselines ab ON re.service = ab.service AND re.operation = ab.operation
WHERE ABS((re.duration_ms - ab.baseline_avg_ms) / NULLIF(ab.baseline_stddev_ms, 0)) > 2  -- Flag outliers
ORDER BY latency_z_score DESC;
```

**Research Question:** Can we build unsupervised anomaly detection models that learn normal agent behavior patterns and flag deviations in real-time?

**Why this is novel:**
- Requires historical trace data with timing + I/O
- Enables detecting "semantic anomalies" (agent doing something unexpected, not just slow)
- Could catch adversarial behaviors or misconfigurations

---

### 1.4 Policy Violation Detection via Trace Analysis

**What makes this unique:** Full I/O capture enables checking if agents violated policies after-the-fact.

**Capability:** Audit agent execution for compliance with organizational policies (privacy, access control, data handling).

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Detect potential privacy violations: agents accessing PII without proper labeling
SELECT
    s1.span_id as violation_span,
    s1.service as violating_agent,
    s1.operation,
    json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].type') as accessed_artifact_type,
    json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].contains_pii') as pii_flag,
    json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.agent.allowed_pii_access') as agent_pii_permission,
    s1.start_time,
    'PRIVACY_VIOLATION: Agent accessed PII without permission' as violation_type
FROM spans s1
WHERE s1.name = 'Agent.execute'
AND json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].contains_pii') = 'true'
AND COALESCE(json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.agent.allowed_pii_access'), 'false') = 'false'
ORDER BY s1.start_time DESC;
```

**Advanced: Cross-Agent Data Leakage Detection**
```sql
-- Detect if private data from one tenant leaked to another tenant's agent
WITH tenant_artifact_flow AS (
    SELECT
        s1.span_id as source_span,
        s1.service as source_agent,
        json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].tenant_id') as source_tenant,
        s2.service as destination_agent,
        json_extract(s2.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].tenant_id') as destination_tenant,
        s1.trace_id
    FROM spans s1
    JOIN spans s2 ON (
        s1.trace_id = s2.trace_id AND
        s2.start_time > s1.end_time AND
        s2.name = 'Agent.execute' AND
        json_extract(s2.attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0].type') = json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.output.type')
    )
    WHERE s1.name = 'Agent.execute'
)
SELECT
    source_agent,
    destination_agent,
    source_tenant,
    destination_tenant,
    trace_id,
    'TENANT_ISOLATION_VIOLATION: Data leaked across tenants' as violation_type
FROM tenant_artifact_flow
WHERE source_tenant != destination_tenant
AND source_tenant IS NOT NULL
AND destination_tenant IS NOT NULL;
```

**Research Question:** Can we formalize "safe agent behavior" as temporal logic constraints and automatically verify them from traces?

**Why this is novel:**
- Enables retroactive compliance auditing
- No other framework captures enough data for policy checking
- Critical for regulated industries (healthcare, finance)

---

### 1.5 Failure Prediction via Historical Pattern Analysis

**What makes this unique:** Time-series trace data enables predicting failures before they occur.

**Capability:** Detect degradation patterns that precede failures (e.g., gradual latency increase before timeout).

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Identify agents showing degradation patterns that typically precede failure
WITH hourly_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        service,
        DATE_TRUNC('hour', TIMESTAMP 'epoch' + start_time / 1000000 * INTERVAL '1 second') as hour,
        AVG(duration_ms) as avg_latency,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status_code = 'ERROR' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) * 100 as error_rate_pct,
        COUNT(*) as request_count
    FROM spans
    WHERE name LIKE '%Agent.execute'
    AND start_time > (EPOCH(NOW()) - 86400 * 7) * 1000000  -- Last 7 days
    GROUP BY service, hour
),
trend_analysis AS (
    SELECT
        service,
        hour,
        avg_latency,
        error_rate_pct,
        -- Calculate trend: current vs 6 hours ago
        avg_latency - LAG(avg_latency, 6) OVER (PARTITION BY service ORDER BY hour) as latency_delta_6h,
        error_rate_pct - LAG(error_rate_pct, 6) OVER (PARTITION BY service ORDER BY hour) as error_delta_6h
    FROM hourly_metrics
)
SELECT
    service,
    hour,
    avg_latency,
    error_rate_pct,
    latency_delta_6h,
    error_delta_6h,
    CASE
        WHEN latency_delta_6h > 1000 AND error_delta_6h > 2 THEN 'CRITICAL: Imminent failure likely'
        WHEN latency_delta_6h > 500 OR error_delta_6h > 1 THEN 'WARNING: Degradation detected'
        ELSE 'STABLE'
    END as health_status
FROM trend_analysis
WHERE hour >= DATE_TRUNC('hour', NOW()) - INTERVAL '24 hours'
AND (latency_delta_6h > 500 OR error_delta_6h > 1)
ORDER BY hour DESC, latency_delta_6h DESC;
```

**Research Question:** Can we train machine learning models to predict agent failures 10-30 minutes in advance based on trace patterns?

**Why this is novel:**
- Requires time-series trace data (not snapshot logs)
- Enables proactive remediation
- Could prevent cascading failures in multi-agent systems

---

### 1.6 Workflow Mining and Agent Dependency Discovery

**What makes this unique:** Blackboard systems have emergent workflows; traces let you reverse-engineer them.

**Capability:** Automatically discover "hidden workflows" by analyzing which agents typically execute together.

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Discover frequently co-occurring agent executions (workflow patterns)
WITH agent_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        s1.trace_id,
        s1.service as agent_1,
        s2.service as agent_2,
        s2.start_time - s1.end_time as time_gap_us,
        json_extract(s1.attributes, '$.output.type') as intermediate_artifact
    FROM spans s1
    JOIN spans s2 ON (
        s1.trace_id = s2.trace_id AND
        s2.start_time > s1.end_time AND
        s2.start_time - s1.end_time < 10000000  -- Within 10 seconds
    )
    WHERE s1.name = 'Agent.execute'
    AND s2.name = 'Agent.execute'
    AND s1.service != s2.service
)
SELECT
    agent_1 || ' → ' || agent_2 as workflow_edge,
    intermediate_artifact,
    COUNT(*) as occurrence_count,
    AVG(time_gap_us / 1000.0) as avg_gap_ms,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY time_gap_us / 1000.0) as p95_gap_ms
FROM agent_pairs
GROUP BY agent_1, agent_2, intermediate_artifact
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10  -- Only frequent patterns
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
```

**Advanced: Detect Workflow Drift**
```sql
-- Compare current workflow patterns to baseline (detect architectural drift)
WITH baseline_workflows AS (
    -- Workflows from 30 days ago
    SELECT agent_1 || ' → ' || agent_2 as edge, COUNT(*) as baseline_count
    FROM (
        SELECT s1.service as agent_1, s2.service as agent_2
        FROM spans s1
        JOIN spans s2 ON s1.trace_id = s2.trace_id AND s2.start_time > s1.end_time
        WHERE s1.start_time BETWEEN (EPOCH(NOW()) - 86400*30) * 1000000 AND (EPOCH(NOW()) - 86400*7) * 1000000
    )
    GROUP BY edge
),
current_workflows AS (
    -- Workflows from last 7 days
    SELECT agent_1 || ' → ' || agent_2 as edge, COUNT(*) as current_count
    FROM (
        SELECT s1.service as agent_1, s2.service as agent_2
        FROM spans s1
        JOIN spans s2 ON s1.trace_id = s2.trace_id AND s2.start_time > s1.end_time
        WHERE s1.start_time > (EPOCH(NOW()) - 86400*7) * 1000000
    )
    GROUP BY edge
)
SELECT
    COALESCE(b.edge, c.edge) as workflow_edge,
    COALESCE(b.baseline_count, 0) as baseline_occurrences,
    COALESCE(c.current_count, 0) as current_occurrences,
    CASE
        WHEN b.edge IS NULL THEN 'NEW_WORKFLOW'
        WHEN c.edge IS NULL THEN 'REMOVED_WORKFLOW'
        WHEN c.current_count::FLOAT / b.baseline_count > 2 THEN 'INCREASED_FREQUENCY'
        WHEN c.current_count::FLOAT / b.baseline_count < 0.5 THEN 'DECREASED_FREQUENCY'
        ELSE 'STABLE'
    END as drift_status
FROM baseline_workflows b
FULL OUTER JOIN current_workflows c ON b.edge = c.edge
WHERE (b.edge IS NULL OR c.edge IS NULL OR ABS(c.current_count::FLOAT / b.baseline_count - 1) > 0.5);
```

**Research Question:** Can we use process mining techniques (Petri nets, declare models) to formalize emergent agent workflows from traces?

**Why this is novel:**
- Process mining typically assumes structured logs; Flock provides structured traces
- Blackboard systems need discovery tools (no predefined workflow)
- Enables documentation generation from execution

---

### 1.7 Agent Communication Pattern Analysis

**What makes this unique:** Operation-level dependency tracking reveals exact method calls between agents.

**Capability:** Understand which operations agents use to interact, detecting anti-patterns.

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Analyze operation-level communication patterns
WITH operation_dependencies AS (
    SELECT
        s1.service as caller,
        s1.operation as caller_operation,
        s2.service as callee,
        s2.operation as callee_operation,
        COUNT(*) as call_count,
        AVG(s2.duration_ms) as avg_callee_duration_ms,
        SUM(CASE WHEN s2.status_code = 'ERROR' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) * 100 as error_rate_pct
    FROM spans s1
    JOIN spans s2 ON (
        s1.trace_id = s2.trace_id AND
        s2.parent_id = s1.span_id  -- Direct parent-child relationship
    )
    WHERE s1.service IS NOT NULL AND s2.service IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY caller, caller_operation, callee, callee_operation
)
SELECT
    caller || '.' || caller_operation as caller_op,
    callee || '.' || callee_operation as callee_op,
    call_count,
    ROUND(avg_callee_duration_ms, 2) as avg_duration_ms,
    ROUND(error_rate_pct, 2) as error_rate_pct,
    CASE
        WHEN error_rate_pct > 10 THEN '⚠️ HIGH_ERROR_RATE'
        WHEN call_count = 1 THEN '🔍 SINGLE_USE (consider inlining)'
        WHEN avg_callee_duration_ms < 1 THEN '⚡ VERY_FAST (consider batching)'
        ELSE '✓ NORMAL'
    END as pattern_analysis
FROM operation_dependencies
ORDER BY call_count DESC;
```

**Research Question:** Can we automatically detect architectural anti-patterns (chatty agents, circular dependencies, overly complex call chains)?

**Why this is novel:**
- Most frameworks show service-level dependencies (A → B)
- Flock shows operation-level (A.execute → B.validate → C.process)
- Enables fine-grained architectural analysis

---

### 1.8 Multi-Agent Cascade Performance Profiling

**What makes this unique:** Complete timing capture enables analyzing cascading latency across agent chains.

**Capability:** Understand how latency compounds when multiple agents execute sequentially.

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Analyze latency amplification in agent cascades
WITH agent_cascade AS (
    SELECT
        trace_id,
        service as agent,
        duration_ms,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY trace_id ORDER BY start_time) as execution_order,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY trace_id) as total_agents_in_trace
    FROM spans
    WHERE name = 'Agent.execute'
),
cascade_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        execution_order,
        COUNT(DISTINCT trace_id) as trace_count,
        AVG(duration_ms) as avg_latency_ms,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) as p95_latency_ms
    FROM agent_cascade
    WHERE total_agents_in_trace > 3  -- Only analyze multi-agent traces
    GROUP BY execution_order
)
SELECT
    execution_order,
    trace_count,
    ROUND(avg_latency_ms, 2) as avg_latency_ms,
    ROUND(p95_latency_ms, 2) as p95_latency_ms,
    -- Latency amplification: how much does each position add?
    ROUND(avg_latency_ms - LAG(avg_latency_ms) OVER (ORDER BY execution_order), 2) as latency_increase_ms,
    CASE
        WHEN execution_order = 1 THEN 'Initial trigger'
        WHEN avg_latency_ms > LAG(avg_latency_ms) OVER (ORDER BY execution_order) * 1.5 THEN 'Bottleneck position'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as analysis
FROM cascade_metrics
ORDER BY execution_order;
```

**Research Question:** Can we model latency propagation in multi-agent systems and predict end-to-end performance from individual agent SLOs?

**Why this is novel:**
- Requires complete cascade timing data
- Enables capacity planning for multi-agent systems
- Could inform agent placement/ordering decisions

---

### 1.9 Testing Oracle: Trace-Based Behavior Validation

**What makes this unique:** Full execution history enables using past traces as test oracles.

**Capability:** Replay inputs from production traces and verify agent behavior hasn't changed (regression testing).

**Conceptual Approach:**
```python
# Extract test case from production trace
def extract_test_case_from_trace(trace_id: str) -> TestCase:
    """Generate reproducible test from production execution."""
    conn = duckdb.connect('.flock/traces.duckdb', read_only=True)

    # Get input that triggered agent
    input_data = conn.execute("""
        SELECT json_extract(attributes, '$.input.artifacts[0]')
        FROM spans
        WHERE trace_id = ? AND name = 'Agent.execute'
        ORDER BY start_time LIMIT 1
    """, [trace_id]).fetchone()[0]

    # Get expected output
    expected_output = conn.execute("""
        SELECT json_extract(attributes, '$.output.value')
        FROM spans
        WHERE trace_id = ? AND name = 'Agent.execute'
        ORDER BY start_time LIMIT 1
    """, [trace_id]).fetchone()[0]

    return TestCase(input=input_data, expected_output=expected_output)

# Replay test and verify behavior
def verify_agent_behavior_matches_trace(agent, test_case: TestCase):
    """Ensure agent produces same output for same input."""
    actual_output = await agent.execute(test_case.input)
    assert actual_output == test_case.expected_output, \
        f"Behavior changed! Expected {test_case.expected_output}, got {actual_output}"
```

**Research Question:** Can we automatically generate test suites from production traces, achieving high coverage with minimal manual effort?

**Why this is novel:**
- Uses real production data (not synthetic tests)
- Captures edge cases humans wouldn't think of
- Enables continuous validation of agent behavior

---

### 1.10 Root Cause Analysis for Cascading Failures

**What makes this unique:** Complete trace hierarchy reveals which agent in a cascade caused downstream failures.

**Capability:** When a cascade fails, pinpoint the original culprit (not just the last agent that errored).

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Find root cause of cascading failures
WITH failed_traces AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT trace_id
    FROM spans
    WHERE status_code = 'ERROR'
    AND name = 'Agent.execute'
),
cascade_timeline AS (
    SELECT
        s.trace_id,
        s.span_id,
        s.service as agent,
        s.operation,
        s.status_code,
        s.status_description,
        s.start_time,
        s.end_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.trace_id ORDER BY s.start_time) as execution_order
    FROM spans s
    WHERE s.trace_id IN (SELECT trace_id FROM failed_traces)
    AND s.name = 'Agent.execute'
)
SELECT
    trace_id,
    agent as root_cause_agent,
    operation,
    status_description as error_message,
    start_time,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cascade_timeline ct2
     WHERE ct2.trace_id = ct.trace_id AND ct2.execution_order > ct.execution_order) as downstream_agents_affected
FROM cascade_timeline ct
WHERE status_code = 'ERROR'
AND execution_order = (
    -- First agent to fail in cascade
    SELECT MIN(execution_order)
    FROM cascade_timeline ct2
    WHERE ct2.trace_id = ct.trace_id AND ct2.status_code = 'ERROR'
)
ORDER BY downstream_agents_affected DESC;
```

**Research Question:** Can we quantify "blast radius" of agent failures and prioritize fixes based on impact?

**Why this is novel:**
- Traditional logs don't capture cascade relationships
- Enables prioritizing high-impact bug fixes
- Critical for production incident response

**Hypothesis:** Agent purpose can be inferred by analyzing input-output transformations across multiple executions.

**Experimental Design:**
1. **Dataset:** 1000 traces from 5 different agent types
2. **Method:** Train classifier on (input_type, output_type, transformation_pattern) → agent_purpose
3. **Baseline:** Human-labeled agent descriptions
4. **Metrics:** Precision/recall of inferred purpose vs. ground truth

**Expected Result:** 80%+ accuracy for common agent types (classifier, transformer, aggregator)

---

### 5.2 Can we detect policy violations automatically?

**Hypothesis:** Temporal logic constraints can formalize "safe agent behavior" and be verified from traces.

**Experimental Design:**
1. **Policies:** Define 10 common policies (e.g., "no PII sharing", "tenant isolation")
2. **Encoding:** Express as SQL queries or LTL formulas
3. **Evaluation:** Inject known violations, measure detection rate
4. **Metrics:** True positive rate, false positive rate, query performance

**Expected Result:** 95%+ detection rate with <5% false positives

### 5.3 Can we predict failures before they occur?

**Hypothesis:** Degradation patterns (latency increase, error rate increase) precede major failures.

**Experimental Design:**
1. **Dataset:** 6 months production traces with labeled incidents
2. **Features:** Time-series metrics (latency, error rate, call frequency)
3. **Model:** Gradient boosting with 10-minute prediction window
4. **Metrics:** Precision/recall, lead time before failure

**Expected Result:** 70%+ precision at 10-minute lead time, enabling proactive mitigation

### 5.4 Can we automatically detect architectural drift?

**Hypothesis:** Agent interaction patterns change significantly when architecture evolves (intentionally or unintentionally).

**Experimental Design:**
1. **Dataset:** Traces from 3 deliberate architectural changes (adding agent, removing dependency, changing workflow)
2. **Method:** Graph comparison (workflow before vs. after) using edit distance
3. **Baseline:** Manual change detection by reviewing code
4. **Metrics:** Sensitivity (detect known changes), specificity (avoid false alarms)

**Expected Result:** 90%+ detection of architectural changes with <10% false alarm rate

---

### 5.5 Can we generate effective tests from production traces?

**Hypothesis:** Production traces capture edge cases that manual tests miss.

**Experimental Design:**
1. **Dataset:** 100 production traces, 50 manually-written tests
