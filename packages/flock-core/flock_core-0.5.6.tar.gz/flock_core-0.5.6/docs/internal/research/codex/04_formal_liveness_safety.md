# Formal Liveness & Safety for Blackboard Agents

Score: 8.9 / 10

## Abstract
We model Flock executions as Petri nets and/or TLA+ specifications to reason about liveness (no starvation), absence of deadlocks, and termination in the presence of joins, batching, and feedback‑loop guards. We validate properties against execution traces and provide static checks for risky configurations.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses
- H1: Subscriptions + typed artifacts map naturally to Petri net places/transitions.
- H2: Prevent‑self‑trigger and iteration caps enforce termination in classes of cyclic workflows.
- H3: Join and batch semantics admit sufficient conditions for liveness that can be checked pre‑run.

## Experiment Sketch
- Formalize a core subset (publish, schedule, join, batch, visibility) in TLA+ and Petri nets.
- Model‑check small systems for deadlock/starvation; derive invariants.
- Build a static analyzer that warns about cycles lacking progress conditions.

## Project Plan (4–6 weeks)
- Week 1: Formal model + examples.
- Week 2: Model checking + counterexamples; map violations to runtime.
- Week 3: Trace conformance: compare predicted vs observed execution graphs from OTel spans.
- Week 4: Static analyzer prototype and docs.

## Metrics
- Number of classes of unsafe configs caught; false‑positive rate; analyzer runtime.

## Value Proposition
- A rare formal treatment of LLM agent orchestration with actionable checks that improve production safety.
