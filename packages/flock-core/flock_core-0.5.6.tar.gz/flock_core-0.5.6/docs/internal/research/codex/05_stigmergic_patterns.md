# Stigmergic Patterns on a Typed Blackboard

Score: 8.7 / 10

## Abstract
Stigmergy—environment‑mediated coordination—can be realized via “digital pheromones”: artifact tags that accumulate/decay and influence agent behavior. We propose stigmergic policies on Flock’s blackboard (e.g., decay functions, reinforcement on consumption) and evaluate emergent coordination vs scripted routing for allocation and retrieval tasks.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses
- H1: Pheromone‑like signals improve task allocation and discovery in open‑ended multi‑agent settings.
- H2: Decay schedules prevent resource hogging and enable exploration/exploitation balance.
- H3: Typed artifacts allow safer stigmergy by scoping signals to schemas and tenants.

## Experiment Sketch
- Implement tag accumulators/evaporators; expose to agent subscriptions as predicates.
- Tasks: document classification at scale; mixed retrieval with overlapping competencies.
- Compare stigmergy vs manual routing and naïve broadcast.

## Project Plan (3–5 weeks)
- Week 1: Implement tag API + decay; unit tests.
- Week 2: Benchmarks; ablate decay, reinforcement, and tag scopes.
- Week 3: Analysis + write‑up; visualizations in dashboard.

## Metrics
- Throughput, success, fairness, convergence time, degree of specialization, and stability.

## Value Proposition
- Demonstrates an orchestration primitive that is hard to express in graph pipelines but natural in a blackboard.
