# Flock Research Workspace

This workspace collects research ideas that leverage Flock’s blackboard‑first, typed‑artifact orchestration. Each idea has:
- Abstract
- Experiment sketch (method)
- Project plan (milestones)
- Value proposition
- Sources/further reading

Scoring rubric: Potential/Value (1–10). Higher scores are higher‑priority.
