# Information‑Flow‑Aware Visibility for Multi‑Tenant Agents

Score: 8.5 / 10

## Abstract
Flock supports visibility controls on artifacts. We propose formalizing label‑based visibility (inspired by DIFC systems like Flume/Laminar) for multi‑tenant agent deployments, with enforcement at publish/consume time and auditable flows.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses
- H1: A label lattice on artifacts prevents cross‑tenant leaks with low runtime overhead.
- H2: Declassification points (audited) enable necessary cross‑tenant workflows while preserving policy guarantees.
- H3: Policy violations can be detected via trace‑level information‑flow analysis.

## Experiment Sketch
- Implement label lattice + policy checks in Flock’s subscription/visibility layer.
- Threat‑model tests: simulate adversarial agents attempting cross‑tenant exfiltration.
- Measure performance overhead and policy violation detection.

## Project Plan (3–5 weeks)
- Week 1: Policy model + enforcement hooks; unit tests.
- Week 2: Adversarial scenarios; trace analysis for flow verification.
- Week 3: Benchmarks + write‑up.

## Metrics
- Policy violation rate (should be 0), overhead %, and auditability (coverage of flows).

## Value Proposition
- A practical, formal security story for enterprises running multi‑tenant agents.
