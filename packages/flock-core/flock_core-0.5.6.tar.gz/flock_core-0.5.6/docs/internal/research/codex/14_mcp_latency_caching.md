# MCP Tool Latency Modeling and Caching Policies

Score: 7.4 / 10

## Abstract
We measure tool discovery and invocation latency across MCP servers and propose caching/allowlisting policies to reduce tail latency and tool errors while maintaining flexibility.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses
- H1: Caching tool metadata and narrowing allowed tools reduces tail latency and misuse.
- H2: Cross‑server variance can be modeled and used to pick faster equivalents when interchangeable.

## Experiment Sketch
- Assemble MCP servers (filesystem, HTTP, GitHub). Run repeated tool discovery and calls; fit latency models.
- Implement and evaluate caching + allowlists; observe impacts on latency, errors, and success.

## Project Plan (3–4 weeks)
- Week 1: Measurement harness.
- Week 2: Policies + evaluation.
- Week 3: Report + guidance for production configs.

## Metrics
- Tool list/call latency distribution (P50/P95/P99), error rates, success.

## Value Proposition
- Practical guidance for MCP deployments; turns a standard into measurable engineering wins.
