# Public Trace Dataset & Compression for Agents

Score: 7.6 / 10

## Abstract
We release an anonymized, synthetic‑but‑realistic dataset of agent traces (OTel‑compatible) and evaluate compression/sampling techniques that preserve scheduling and failure analysis value while reducing storage.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses
- H1: Simple span‑level sampling and structure‑aware compression preserves most analytical utility.
- H2: A public trace format for agents accelerates meta‑research on orchestration and reliability.

## Experiment Sketch
- Generate diverse traces from Flock workloads; anonymize and publish with schema.
- Evaluate compression (columnar, dictionary encoding) and sampling (tail‑biased, error‑biased) for specific analyses.

## Project Plan (3–5 weeks)
- Week 1: Dataset curation and docs.
- Week 2: Compression/sampling evaluation; tasks: bottleneck detection, error chains, causal paths.
- Week 3: Report + release.

## Metrics
- Size reduction vs analysis accuracy (precision/recall of findings), query latency.

## Value Proposition
- Establishes a standard artifact for agent systems research and makes Flock a reference platform for evaluation.
