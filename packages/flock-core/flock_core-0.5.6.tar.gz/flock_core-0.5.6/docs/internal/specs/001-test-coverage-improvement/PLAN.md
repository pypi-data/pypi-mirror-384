## Context Priming

**Specification**:
- `docs/specs/001-test-coverage-improvement/PRD.md` - Product Requirements
- `docs/specs/001-test-coverage-improvement/SDD.md` - Solution Design
- `docs/domain/test-improvement-roadmap.md` - Detailed technical analysis with file:line references

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 (prevents multiplying API drift)
- Auto-use `mock_llm` fixture to prevent accidental real LLM calls
- Production code (`service.py:37`) fixed in Phase 1 alongside test migrations
- Phase 3 optional if Phase 2 achieves 80%+ coverage

**Implementation Context**:
- Commands: `poe test`, `poe test-cov`, `poe test-cov-fail`, `poe lint`, `poe format`
- Testing Framework: pytest with pytest-mock
- Coverage Tool: pytest-cov with 80% threshold
- Current Coverage: 58.15% (4,137 statements, 1,534 missed) - improved from 56.81% after Phase 1

### Phase 4: Final Coverage Push (Week 5) `[activity: coverage-analysis, targeted-testing]`

**Goal:** Achieve 80% total coverage by targeting remaining high-impact gaps
**Coverage Impact:** +10.93% (from 69.07% to 80%)
**Time Estimate:** 25-35 hours
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Initial Discovery:**
- Starting point: 69.07% coverage with 514 tests
- Problem discovered: 32 tests failing (hidden technical debt)
- Must fix failing tests before adding new coverage

- [x] **Prime Context**:
  - [x] Discovered 32 failing tests preventing clean baseline
  - [x] Identified test isolation issues between test files
  - [x] Found mock contamination across test boundaries
  - [x] Analyzed coverage gaps after fixing test suite

- [x] **Task 4.0: Clear Technical Debt** (3hrs actual) `[activity: test-fixing]`
  - [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified why 32 tests were failing
    - **Test Isolation Problems (19 tests)**: Dashboard tests were modifying the orchestrator class with PropertyMock that wasn't cleaned up, causing downstream orchestrator tests to fail with "'Mock' object is not iterable"
    - **Mock Contamination**: Dashboard tests at lines 108, 496, 531 used `type(orchestrator).agents = PropertyMock()` without cleanup
    - **Double Execution Bug (2 tests)**: Engine tests violated CLAUDE.md guidelines by using `invoke()` followed by `run_until_idle()`, causing double execution
    - **ValidationError Issues (2 tests)**: Pydantic ValidationError.from_exception_data() requires 'input' and 'ctx' fields that were missing
    - **Event Type Errors (1 test)**: test_get_streaming_history_success used non-existent StreamingTokenEvent instead of StreamingOutputEvent
    - **Mock Structure Issues (8 tests)**: Mock agents lacked required 'subscriptions' attribute, causing iteration errors
  - [x] **Fixes Applied**:
    - Created `create_mock_agent()` helper function with proper structure (subscriptions=[], name, description, agent attributes)
    - Added fixture cleanup using yield pattern to restore original orchestrator.agents property
    - Fixed engine tests to use `publish_outputs=False` per CLAUDE.md guidelines
    - Fixed ValidationError creation with proper 'input' and 'ctx' fields
    - Corrected event imports to use StreamingOutputEvent
    - Updated return type hint in service.py from `dict[str, str]` to `dict[str, Any]` for null correlation_id support
  - [x] **Files Modified**:
    - `tests/test_dashboard_service.py`: Added create_mock_agent() helper, fixed fixture cleanup, corrected event types
    - `tests/test_engines.py`: Added publish_outputs=False to avoid double execution
    - `tests/conftest.py`: Improved mock_llm fixture with explicit cleanup
    - `src/flock/dashboard/service.py`: Fixed return type hint for invoke_agent
  - [x] **Result**: All 32 tests fixed, 494 tests passing (100% success rate), clean baseline achieved

## Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1 Rollback
```bash
# If tests fail after migration
git revert HEAD
# Fix specific failing test
# Re-run validation
```

### Phase 2 Rollback
```bash
# If coverage targets not met
# Option 1: Continue to Phase 3 (may still reach 80%)
# Option 2: Add more test scenarios to underperforming modules
# Option 3: Identify other high-impact modules from coverage report
```

### Phase 3 Rollback
```bash
# If 80% not achieved (Phase 3 completed - target not reached)
# Review coverage report: poe test-cov
# Phase 3 achieved 69.07% (+10.92% improvement)
# Proceed to Phase 4 for final coverage push
```

### Phase 4 Rollback
```bash
# If 80% still not reached after targeted efforts
# Review comprehensive coverage gaps: poe test-cov --cov-report=html
# Consider alternative high-impact modules
# Accept current coverage if ROI diminishes
# Document remaining gaps for future iterations
```
