## Product Overview

### Vision
Enable developers to effortlessly transform list-based artifacts into parallel processing workflows through an intuitive fan-out pattern that maximizes system throughput.

### Problem Statement
Flock users currently cannot easily distribute list items for parallel processing. When an agent publishes a list artifact (e.g., 10 research queries), downstream agents receive the entire list as a single unit, forcing sequential processing and limiting parallelism. This creates performance bottlenecks and underutilizes available computing resources.

### Value Proposition
The fan-out pattern provides automatic list expansion with zero configuration overhead, enabling true parallel processing that can reduce workflow execution time by 5-10x while maintaining clean, intuitive agent definitions.

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: AI Workflow Developer
- **Demographics:** 25-45 years old, software engineer or ML engineer, strong Python skills, familiar with async patterns
- **Goals:** Build efficient AI agent workflows that process data quickly and scale to production workloads
- **Pain Points:** Current sequential processing is slow, complex parallel patterns require manual orchestration, difficult to visualize parallel execution in dashboards

### Secondary Personas

#### Data Scientist
- **Demographics:** 28-50 years old, research-oriented, moderate programming skills
- **Goals:** Process large datasets through AI pipelines efficiently
- **Pain Points:** Waiting for sequential processing, unclear how to parallelize workflows

## User Journey Maps

### Primary User Journey: Implementing Parallel Processing
1. **Awareness:** Developer notices agent processing lists sequentially, sees performance bottleneck
2. **Consideration:** Evaluates manual parallelization vs built-in patterns
3. **Adoption:** Discovers `.fan_out()` method in documentation/autocomplete
4. **Usage:** Adds `.fan_out()` to publishing agent, downstream agents automatically process items in parallel
5. **Retention:** Significant performance improvement keeps them using the pattern

## Feature Requirements

### Must Have Features

#### Feature 1: Automatic List Expansion
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want to publish list artifacts that automatically expand so that downstream agents process items in parallel
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] Lists expand into individual artifacts when `.fan_out()` is called
  - [x] Each item maintains correlation ID for tracking
  - [x] Expansion is configurable (field name, max items)

#### Feature 2: Dashboard Visualization
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want to see fan-out patterns in the dashboard so that I understand parallel processing flow
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] Fan-out nodes show expansion count
  - [x] Parallel processing visible in graph
  - [x] Progress tracking for each item

#### Feature 3: Parallel Streaming Support
- **User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to see multiple agents streaming simultaneously so that I can monitor parallel execution
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] Multiple agents can stream in dashboard mode
  - [x] CLI maintains single-stream for clean output
  - [x] Runtime mode detection automatic

### Should Have Features
- Batch event support for large fan-outs (>50 items)
- Configurable layout algorithms (tree, radial, linear)
- Fan-in component for result aggregation
- Performance metrics per expanded item

### Could Have Features
- Auto-detection of list types without explicit `.fan_out()`
- Dynamic routing based on item content
- Replay visualization of fan-out execution
- Export fan-out metrics to monitoring systems

### Won't Have (This Phase)
- Automatic retry for failed items
- Complex routing logic (content-based routing)
- Cross-orchestrator fan-out
- Database-backed state persistence

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Fan-Out Component Implementation
**Description:** A reusable component that intercepts agent evaluation results and expands list artifacts into individual items for parallel processing.

**User Flow:**
1. User adds `.fan_out()` to agent builder
2. System injects FanOutComponent into agent
3. User publishes artifact with list field
4. System intercepts in post_evaluate hook
5. System expands list into individual artifacts
6. System publishes each to blackboard separately

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: When list field contains array, expand into N individual artifacts
- Rule 2: Preserve parent metadata and correlation IDs
- Rule 3: Add sequence metadata (index, total) to each item
- Rule 4: Non-list artifacts pass through unchanged

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: Empty list → No artifacts published (intentional no-op)
- Scenario 2: Non-existent field → Pass through unchanged, log warning
- Scenario 3: >1000 items → Apply max_items limit, log truncation

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Adoption:** 60% of workflows using lists adopt fan-out within 3 months
- **Performance:** 5x average speedup for workflows with 10+ list items
- **Quality:** <0.1% failure rate for fan-out operations
- **Developer Satisfaction:** 4.5+ rating on ease of use

### Tracking Requirements

| Event | Properties | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| fan_out_configured | agent_name, list_field, max_items | Track adoption |
| fan_out_executed | parent_id, item_count, duration | Monitor performance |
| fan_out_error | error_type, agent_name | Identify issues |
| parallel_streams_active | count, runtime_mode | Validate parallel execution |

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- CLI display limited to single stream (terminal constraints)
- Memory limits for very large fan-outs (>10,000 items)

### Assumptions
- Users understand basic parallel processing concepts
- Dashboard users have modern browsers (Chrome 90+)
- Average fan-out size is 10-50 items
- WebSocket connection stable for streaming

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Memory exhaustion with large lists | High | Low | Implement max_items limit, use streaming |
| WebSocket overload with many streams | Medium | Medium | Batch events, implement backpressure |
| User confusion about parallel behavior | Low | Medium | Clear documentation, visual indicators |

## Open Questions

- [x] Should fan-out be automatic or explicit? → Decision: Explicit via `.fan_out()`
- [x] How to handle partial failures? → Decision: Independent item processing
- [ ] Default max_items limit? → Needs performance testing
