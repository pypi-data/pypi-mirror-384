## Specification Compliance Guidelines

### How to Ensure Specification Adherence

1. **Before Each Phase**: Complete the Pre-Implementation Specification Gate
2. **During Implementation**: Reference specific architecture doc sections in each task
3. **After Each Task**: Run Specification Compliance checks (pytest for backend)
4. **Phase Completion**: Verify all specification requirements are met

### Deviation Protocol

If implementation cannot follow specification exactly:
1. Document the deviation and reason
2. Get approval before proceeding
3. Update architecture docs if the deviation is an improvement
4. Never deviate without documentation

## Metadata Reference

- `[parallel: true]` - Tasks that can run concurrently
- `[component: component-name]` - For multi-component features
- `[ref: document/section; lines: 1, 2-3]` - Links to specifications, patterns, or interfaces and (if applicable) line(s)
- `[activity: type]` - Activity hint for specialist agent selection

---

## Context Priming

*GATE: You MUST fully read all files mentioned in this section before starting any implementation.*

**Specification Documents**:

- `docs/internal/logic-operations-ux/03_backend_api_architecture.md` - Complete API design, schemas, implementation strategy (Backend SDD equivalent) `[ref: lines: 1-1378]`
- `docs/internal/logic-operations-ux/01_waiting_states_research.md` - UX requirements, industry research, success criteria (Requirements equivalent) `[ref: lines: 1-1545]`
- `docs/internal/logic-operations-ux/04_visual_design_system.md` - Visual design tokens, component patterns (Design system) `[ref: lines: 1-1630]`
- `docs/internal/logic-operations-ux/02_countdown_progress_design.md` - Countdown timer and progress indicator patterns `[ref: lines: 1-937]`
- `docs/internal/logic-operations-ux/05_implementation_roadmap.md` - 6-week roadmap with 21 tasks (Source for this plan) `[ref: lines: 1-1271]`

**Key Design Decisions**:

- **Backend-Heavy Approach**: Backend computes all display state (urgency, progress, predictions), frontend only renders `[ref: 03_backend_api_architecture.md; lines: 21-22]`
- **WebSocket Real-Time Updates**: Push state updates every 1-2 seconds for live countdowns `[ref: 03_backend_api_architecture.md; lines: 841-884]`
- **TDD for Backend**: All backend state tracking, event emission, and API endpoints require tests first `[ref: 05_implementation_roadmap.md; lines: 849-862]`
- **Manual Validation for UI**: Frontend uses screenshot-based validation instead of automated tests `[ref: 05_implementation_roadmap.md; lines: 484-649]`
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Extend existing `/api/agents` endpoint, don't modify schemas `[ref: 03_backend_api_architecture.md; lines: 23]`

**Implementation Context**:

- **Commands to run**:
  - Backend tests: `pytest src/flock/tests/dashboard/test_logic_operations_api.py -v`
  - Example validation: `python examples/02-dashboard/13_medical_diagnostics_joinspec.py`
  - Dashboard: `npm run dev` (frontend)
- **Patterns to follow**: Backend state computation patterns `[ref: 03_backend_api_architecture.md; lines: 187-445]`
- **Interfaces to implement**:
  - Enhanced `/api/agents` response schema `[ref: 03_backend_api_architecture.md; lines: 108-185]`
  - New WebSocket events: `CorrelationGroupUpdatedEvent`, `BatchItemAddedEvent` `[ref: 03_backend_api_architecture.md; lines: 453-740]`
