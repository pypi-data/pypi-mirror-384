> [!Bug] Bugs
> - [ ] Fix order upon refresh
>   - [ ] when the item order refreshes (e.g. new downloads added) the selected items change. need to associate the selected items with gids and then create new selected items which will be passed back
> - [ ] (!!!) Fix cursor position upon refresh
>   - [ ] takes us back to the top when it refreshes in a different mode (I think due to filter)
>   - [ ] add pin_cursor option to pqrevent the cursor from going down when refreshing
>   - [ ] might have to do with filtering; 
>   - [ ] when original sort order there is no jumping
>   - [ ] lots of jumping when sorting by size
> - [ ] Filter/search problems
>   - [ ] ^[^\s] matches all rows in help but only highlights the first col
>     - [ ] seems to match the expression in any col but then only show highlights based on the row_str so misses matches in the second col
>  - [ ] restrict refresh so that it doesn't exit on the menu
>  - [x] infobox causes flickering
>   - [x] Caused by stdscr.clear() which we called when creating the new Picker(). We need to use stdscr.erase().
> - [ ] Overspill of selected header column by one character
> - [ ] Prevent input field from overwriting footer values.
>   - [x] Fixed after input has finished.
> - [x] Fix display of size for torrent with multiple files
>    - [x] Torrent size shows size of first file in torrent if there are multiple files...
> - [x] Exiting from change options still changes options
>   - [x] Check if selected_indices is empty first.
> - [ ] Slow navigation when we have a search query and many downloads with 1 second refresh rate
> - [ ] When we add a torrent path that doesn't exist we get a crash.
> - [ ] Opening Files:
>   - [ ] When we try to open a download that has been moved it prints 'xdg-mimetype argument missing'. 
>    - Check for file existence, if it doesn't exist then suppress stderr and show a notification.




> [!Tip] Done
> - [x] If a download is paused and it is paused again it throws an error when it should just skip it.
> - [x] implement addTorrent
> - [x] Return a list of files and % completed for each file in a torrent.
> - [x] check if remove completed/errored is working
> - [x] show all downloads (not just 500)
>   - set max=5000 which should be fine
>   - had to set the max in the aria config file as well
> - [x] Add a getAllInfo option for downloads
> - [x] open location
> - [x] figure out how to keep the row constant when going back and forth between menus
> - [x] make fetching active, queue, and stopped downloads into a batch request
> - [x] (!!!) high CPU usage
>   - when val in `stdscr.timeout(val)` is low the cpu usage is high
> - [x] colour problems:
>   - aria2tui > view downloads > 'q' > 'z' 
>   - [x] fixed by arbitarily setting 0-50 for application colours, 50-100 for help colours and 100-150 for notification colours
> - [x] have to open watch active twice; first time exits immediately...
> - [x] add preview of selected downloads when selecting options

> - [x] get all function
> - [x] fix not resizing properly
> - [x] watch active only refreshes upon a keypress
> - [x] (!!!) add retry download function by getting download data, remove it and readd it
> - [x] info is wrong for torrents. The size, % completed, etc. Might need to rework the the data scraped from the json response.
> - [x] after nvim is opened (e.g., show all dl info) the display needs to be redrawn
> - [x] (!!!) there is a problem with the path when readding downloads sometimes. It is correct in the download info but is displayed wrong???
>   - [x] was caused by discordant order of getting download options and the main download information
> - [x] fix dir; it should be obtained from getInfo; 
> - [x] Add a view all tasks option
