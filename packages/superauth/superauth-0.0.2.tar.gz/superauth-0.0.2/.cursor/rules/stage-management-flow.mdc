description: Documents the contact stage management system flow, state transitions and stage hierarchy
The contact stage management system implements hierarchical contact states within the Apollo.io integration:
Key Components:
1. Stage Hierarchy
- Integrated with Apollo.io's native contact stage system
- Manages stage transitions and state validation
- Maintains parent-child relationships between stages
2. Stage Transitions
- Enforces valid state changes based on Apollo.io's contact workflow
- Handles stage progression through the contact lifecycle
- Implements business rules for allowed/disallowed transitions
Relevant Files:
- src/ant/apollo_io/apollo.py (Primary stage management implementation)
Technical Flow:
1. Contact stages are managed through Apollo's hierarchical system
2. Stage transitions follow Apollo.io's defined contact workflow
3. Integration provides access to stage management functionality
Importance Score: 45/100
- Implements critical contact stage workflow
- Integrates with external stage management system
- Limited custom business logic beyond API integration

Based on the Apollo.io integration implementation:

Stage Management Hierarchy:
1. Contact entry points from external sources (Apollo.io)
2. Stage transitions defined in contact workflows
3. Custom stage management and validation rules

Core Components (src/superauth/apollo_io/apollo.py):
- Stage transition management for contact workflows
- Business-specific stage validation
- Stage-based contact filtering and grouping

Importance Score: 65/100
