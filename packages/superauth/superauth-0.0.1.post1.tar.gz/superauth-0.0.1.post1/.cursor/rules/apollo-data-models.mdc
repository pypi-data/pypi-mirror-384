description: Documentation of Apollo.io data models, contact management, and API interaction structures
## Core Data Structures
### Apollo Class Hierarchy
- Parent class managing API authentication and core Apollo.io interactions
- Handles domain-specific constraints for Apollo.io API access
- Enforces business rules for pagination (1-100 per page, max 500 pages)
### Contact Management Model
- Contact class implementing Apollo.io's contact stage system
- Structured query parameter handling for contact search operations
- Parent-child relationship with Apollo base class for authentication inheritance
## Business Domain Logic
### Contact Search Implementation
- Domain-specific contact search with Apollo.io constraints
- Structured parameter validation for Apollo.io's API requirements
- Contact stage hierarchy management and state transitions
### Domain Authentication
- Apollo.io-specific authentication handling
- Business domain error boundaries for API limitations
- Integrated access control for contact management operations
Importance Score: 35/100
- Implements Apollo.io's specific business requirements
- Provides structured interface for domain operations
- Focuses on API integration with business constraints
- Limited complex domain-specific processing

### ApolloContact Class
Primary data structure for representing Apollo.io contacts with:
- Contact lifecycle stage management 
- Workflow state transitions
- Custom field mappings for CRM integration
Importance Score: 85/100

### ContactBase Class
Abstract base class defining:
- Required contact properties 
- Field validation rules
- Status tracking for sync operations
Importance Score: 80/100

### ContactHierarchy
Class relationship structure:
```
ContactBase
  └── ApolloContact
      └── EnrichedContact
```
Enforces data consistency across contact operations
Importance Score: 75/100

## Integration Models

### ContactSync

- Conflict resolution rules
Importance Score: 70/100

### WorkflowStages
Defines contact progression through:
- Initial prospect
- Qualification
- Enrichment
- Active engagement
- Archived
Importance Score: 65/100
