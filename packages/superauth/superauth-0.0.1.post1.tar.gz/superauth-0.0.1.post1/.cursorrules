# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
The project implements an Apollo.io API integration layer with two primary business components:
## Contact Search Management
Located in `src/ant/apollo_io/apollo.py`, this component:
- Enforces domain-specific pagination rules (1-100 contacts per page)
- Implements maximum depth constraints of 500 pages
- Handles structured contact search parameters
- Maintains business-domain authentication context
## Contact Stage System
The contact stage management system provides:
- Integration with Apollo.io's hierarchical stage organization
- Stage transition handling
- Contact stage status tracking
## Business Logic Score: 35/100
The implementation primarily serves as a structured API wrapper with basic business constraints and validation rules. While it enforces specific Apollo.io business requirements, it contains limited complex domain logic or unique business algorithms.

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
