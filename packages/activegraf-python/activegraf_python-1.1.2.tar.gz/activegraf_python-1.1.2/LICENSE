PLEASE REVIEW THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE “AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY. BY CHECKING THE BOX OR CLICKING THE BUTTON TO CONFIRM YOUR ACCEPTANCE WHEN YOU FIRST INSTALL THE SOFTWARE, YOU CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY AND BECOME A PARTY TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT CHECK THE BOX OR CLICK THE BUTTON AND DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.  IF THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY THROUGH LICENSOR’S WEBSITE) IS BEING USED ON BEHALF OF A CORPORATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” AND “LICENSEE” SHALL BE UNDERSTOOD TO REFER TO SUCH LEGAL ENTITY.

Important: This Agreement for ActiveGraf software is a legal agreement between the licensee (“Licensee”) (either an individual or a business or legal entity), as accepted when the Software was first installed, and ActiveGraf, Inc., the licensor (“ActiveGraf”). This Agreement is for the ActiveGraf software that accompanies this Agreement, including any associated media, printed materials and documentation (“Software”). The Software also includes all updates, replacements, revisions, enhancements, additions, conversions, modifications, copies, derivative works, inventions, discoveries, patentable or copyrightable matter, concepts, expertise, techniques, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other related legal rights of the foregoing items. By checking the box or clicking the button to confirm your acceptance when you first install the Software, using or otherwise accessing the Software in any way, the Licensee agrees to be bound by and becomes a party to the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee should immediately return the Software and this package to the party from whom Licensee obtained or received it. Licensee should maintain a copy of this license for its records.

Use on a PC. You may install the single registered copy of the Software on one storage device for one computer, and you may access and use the Software at that location so long as only one copy of the Software is in operation. If you are a private business rather than an individual, you may authorize the personnel associated with your business to use the Software, but only one person at a time, on one computer at a time.

Use on a Network. You may store, install and access the registered version of the Software through an internal network; provided that you obtain and pay for a license for each workstation that will access the Software through the network. For instance, if 5 different workstations will access the Software on the network, each workstation must have its own paid-up license, regardless of whether the workstations use the Software at different times or concurrently.

Licensee shall not have any right, title, or interest to the Software except as provided in this Agreement, and further shall secure and protect the Software consistent with maintenance of ActiveGraf’s proprietary rights therein.

Licensee acknowledges that the unauthorized disclosure of such confidential information could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to ActiveGraf which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Licensee shall indemnify ActiveGraf against any loss and expense arising due to such unauthorized disclosure. Furthermore, Licensee agrees that ActiveGraf shall have the right to obtain an immediate injunction enjoining any such unauthorized disclosure.

Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless ActiveGraf from and against all losses, claims, damages or other causes of any nature or kind whatsoever (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising directly or indirectly out of third-party claims concerning (i) a breach of any of Licensee’s obligations, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein and (ii) the negligence or intentional misconduct of Licensee or Licensee’s officers, employees, agents, representatives, or contractors.

7. General Terms

7.1 Non-Assignment. Licensee may not assign this Agreement or Licensee’s rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of ActiveGraf and any such assignment shall be null and void.

7.2 Export. Software, including technical data, is subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. Licensee agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain such licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.

7.3 Equitable Relief. Licensee acknowledge that any breach of Licensee’s obligations hereunder with respect to the Software or the confidential information of ActiveGraf will cause ActiveGraf irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law, and therefore that ActiveGraf will be entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief, including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, to prevent any unauthorized use of the Software and Confidential Information, in addition to all other remedies available to it under this Agreement or other applicable law.

7.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between the parties relating to its subject matter. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, express or implied. This Agreement can be amended or modified only by a writing executed in advance by duly authorized representatives of each of the parties hereto. In the event any foreign ministry or other governmental entity or agency makes any changes, deletions or modifications to this Agreement, holds any provision herein unenforceable or imposes any conditions or restrictions on either party to this Agreement which affects its ability to fully perform, ActiveGraf shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement as indicated above, Licensee represent and warrant that all consents, approval or authorizations of third-parties, foreign ministries or any governmental entities or agencies, required as a precondition or otherwise necessary for Licensee to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement have been duly obtained.

7.5 Waiver. A waiver of any breach of default of this Agreement shall not create a waiver of the term or of any subsequent breach of default.

7.6 Governing Law; Choice of Venue. The validity of this Agreement and the rights, obligations and relations of the parties hereunder shall be construed and determined under and in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of North Carolina with respect to claims governed by state law and the laws of the United States with respect to claims arising under the laws of the United States, without regard to conflicts of laws principles and excluding the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any action arising from or relating to this Agreement or the conduct of the parties pursuant hereto shall be commenced and heard solely within a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction found within the boundaries of the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, and ActiveGraf and Licensee each consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in any such court.

7.7 Severability; Force Majeure. Should any term or provision of this Agreement be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid, unenforceable or contrary to law or equity, the offending term shall be modified and limited (or if strictly necessary, deleted) only to the extent required to conform to the requirements of law and the remainder of this Agreement (or, as the case may be, the application of such provisions to other circumstances) shall not be affected thereby but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law. Neither party shall be in default or be liable for any delay, failure in performance (excepting the obligation to pay) or interruption of service resulting directly or indirectly from any cause beyond its reasonable control.

7.8 Government Use. The Software is provided with restricted rights. The Software and user documentation qualify as “commercial items” as defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 48 C.F.R. 12.212.
