Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to add and manage the Modbus MCP server as a dependency in your project, or install it directly via `uv pip install` or `pip install`. See the [Installation](https://github.com/ezhuk/modbus-mcp/blob/main/docs/modbus-mcp/installation.mdx) section of the documentation for full installation instructions and more details.

```bash
uv add modbus-mcp
```

The server can be embedded in and run directly from your application. By default, it exposes a `Streamable HTTP` endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/`.

```python
# app.py
from modbus_mcp import ModbusMCP

mcp = ModbusMCP()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http")
```

It can also be launched from the command line using the provided `CLI` without modifying the source code.

```bash
modbus-mcp
```

Or in an ephemeral, isolated environment using `uvx`. Check out the [Using tools](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) guide for more details.

```bash
uvx modbus-mcp
```

### Configuration

For the use cases where most operations target a specific device, such as a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) or Modbus gateway, its connection settings (`host`, `port`, and `unit`) can be specified at runtime using environment variables so that all prompts that omit explicit connection parameters will be routed to this device.

```bash
export MODBUS_MCP_MODBUS__HOST=10.0.0.1
export MODBUS_MCP_MODBUS__PORT=502
export MODBUS_MCP_MODBUS__UNIT=1
```

These settings can also be specified in a `.env` file in the working directory.

```text
# .env
modbus_mcp_modbus__host=10.0.0.1
modbus_mcp_modbus__port=502
modbus_mcp_modbus__unit=1
```

When interacting with multiple devices, each deviceâ€™s connection parameters (`host`, `port`, `unit`) can be defined with a unique `name` in a `devices.json` file in the working directory. Prompts can then refer to devices by `name`.

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {"name": "Boiler", "host": "10.0.0.3", "port": 503, "unit": 3},
    {"name": "Valve", "host": "10.0.0.4", "port": 504, "unit": 4}
  ]
}
```

### MCP Inspector

To confirm the server is up and running and explore available resources and tools, run the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and connect it to the Modbus MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/`. Make sure to set the transport to `Streamable HTTP`.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
