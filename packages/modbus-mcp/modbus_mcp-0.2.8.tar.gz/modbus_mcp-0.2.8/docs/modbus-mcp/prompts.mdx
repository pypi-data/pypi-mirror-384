Structured response messages are implemented using [prompts](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts) that help guide the interaction, clarify missing parameters, and handle errors gracefully.

```python
@mcp.prompt(name="modbus_help", tags={"modbus", "help"})
def modbus_help() -> list[Message]:
    """Provides examples of how to use the Modbus MCP server."""
    ...
```

Here are some example text inputs that can be used to interact with the server.

```text
Please read the value of register 40001 on 127.0.0.1:502.
Set register 40005 to 123 on host 192.168.1.10, unit 3.
Write [1, 2, 3] to holding registers starting at address 40010.
What is the status of input register 30010 on 10.0.0.5?
```
