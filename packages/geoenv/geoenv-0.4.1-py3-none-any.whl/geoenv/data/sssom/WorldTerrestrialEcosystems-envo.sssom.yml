mapping_set_description: This mapping set is a manually curated alignment of World Terrestrial Ecosystems 2020 (WTE; https://doi.org/10.5066/P9DO61LP) with the Environment Ontology (ENVO; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.owl). Property alignment was created using the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM; https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baac035). The motivation of this mapping is to facilitate the classification of environmental properties, in ENVO terms, via queries against the WTE data source. A high degree of precision was attempted. Note, the WTE terminology is not a part of a formal semantic resource with web resolvable entities. Therefore, values in the subject_id field of WorldTerrestrialEcosystems-envo.sssom.tsv (CURIEs), will not be web resolvable once expanded. The curie_map property for WTE below, lists the authoritative definitions for the mapped WTE ecosystem attributes, which takes the form of a research article.
