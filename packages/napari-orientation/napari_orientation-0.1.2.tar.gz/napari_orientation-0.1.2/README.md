A napari plugin to analyse local orientation in images.


## Installation

You can install the plugin from the napari GUI interface by going to ```Plugins/Install\Uninstall Plugins``` and selecting `napari-orientation`.
Alternatively, you can install the plugin from the napari conda environment via [pip]:

```
pip install napari-orientation
```

## Usage

You can access all the functionalities of the plugin from the menu ```Plugins\Orientation Analysis```.

All the analyses work only on single-channel 2D images and on single-channel 2D time series.
In this last case the analysis can be restricted to single frames.

The only parameter available is the sigma smoothing, in pixels, which controls the strength of the gaussian filter applied to the gradient of the image before computing the orientation vector pixelwise.

### Compute orientation metrics

This GUI gives access to most of the functionalities. You can compute several metrics and display them as images.

#### Display Colored Orientation

It computes an image where each pixel is colored differently according to the orientation angle estimated at that position.

#### Display Coherence

It computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the coherence estimated at that position.

#### Display Curvature

It computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the curvature estimated at that position.

#### Display Angle

It computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the angle, in degrees, estimated at that position.

#### Compute statistics

Estimate the average value for the following metrics: Energy, Coherence, Correlation length, Curvature. The curvature is the only metric in physical units, and therefore the determination of its values relies on the accuracy of the pixel size provided for the image.

### Generate vector-coded images
It generates a vector layer displaying the orientation field estimated locally, over a grid with spacing defined by the user.

This is a separate widget because it currently only works on single frames.

## Credits

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template] (None).

This work was inspired by the plugin [OrientationJ] for ImageJ, that was partially converted by the same developers into a [plugin for napari](https://github.com/EPFL-Center-for-Imaging/napari-orientationpy).

napari-orientation focuses on the computation of several metrics, some of them proposed in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13702-4)
