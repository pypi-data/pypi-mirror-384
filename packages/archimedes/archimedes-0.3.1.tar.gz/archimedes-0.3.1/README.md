**Archimedes** is an open-source Python framework designed to simplify the development of complex engineering systems by providing tools for **modeling**, **simulation**, **optimization**, **controls**, and **hardware deployment**. 
The ultimate goal is to make it possible to do practical
hardware engineering with Python.

For more details, see the [documentation site](https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/)

### Key features

By combining the powerful symbolic capabilities of [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/docs/) with the intuitive interface designs of NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX, Archimedes provides a number of key features:

* NumPy-compatible array API with automatic dispatch
* Efficient execution of computational graphs in compiled C++
* Automatic differentiation with forward- and reverse-mode sparse autodiff
* Interface to "plugin" solvers for ODE/DAEs, root-finding, and nonlinear programming
* Automated C code generation for embedded applications
* JAX-style function transformations
* PyTorch-style hierarchical data structures for parameters and dynamics modeling

**‚ö†Ô∏è API Stability Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Archimedes is currently pre-1.0 software. The API is still evolving and may change between minor versions. We'll document breaking changes in the changelog and will follow semantic versioning for 0.X releases, but expect to see some instability until version 1.0 is released.

# Examples

### Automatic differentiation

```python
import numpy as np
import archimedes as arc

def f(x):
    return np.sin(x**2)

df = arc.grad(f)
np.allclose(df(1.0), 2.0 * np.cos(1.0))
```

### ODE solving with SUNDIALS

```python
import numpy as np
import archimedes as arc


# Lotka-Volterra model
def f(t, x):
    a, b, c, d = 1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0
    return np.hstack([
        a * x[0] - b * x[0] * x[1],
        c * x[0] * x[1] - d * x[1],
    ])


x0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0])
t_span = (0.0, 10.0)
t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 100)

xs = arc.odeint(f, t_span=t_span, x0=x0, t_eval=t_eval)
```

### Constrained optimization

The [constrained Rosenbrock problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization) has a local minimum at (0, 0) and a global minimum at (1, 1)

```python
import numpy as np
import archimedes as arc

def f(x):
    return 100 * (x[1] - x[0] ** 2) ** 2 + (1 - x[0]) ** 2

def g(x):
    g1 = (x[0] - 1) ** 3 - x[1] + 1
    g2 = x[0] + x[1] - 2
    return np.hstack([g1, g2])

x_opt = arc.minimize(f, constr=g, x0=[2.0, 0.0], constr_bounds=(-np.inf, 0))
print(np.allclose(x_opt, [1.0, 1.0], atol=1e-3))
```

### C code generation

Archimedes can convert plain NumPy functions to standalone C code for use in embedded applications:

```python
import numpy as np
import archimedes as arc

def f(x, y):
    return x + np.sin(y)

# Create templates with appropriate shapes and dtypes
x_type = np.zeros((), dtype=float)
y_type = np.zeros((2,), dtype=float)

arc.codegen(f, (x_type, y_type), return_names=("z", ))
```

For more details, see the tutorial on [C code generation](https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/tutorials/codegen/codegen00.html)

# Installation

### Basic setup

The easiest way to install is from PyPI:

```bash
pip install archimedes
```

Test with any of the examples shown above.

### Recommended setup

For development (or just a more robust environment configuration), we recommend using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for faster dependency resolution and virtual environment management:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment 
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install with minimal dependencies
uv pip install archimedes

# OR install with extras (control, jupyter, matplotlib, etc.)
uv pip install archimedes[all]
```

To install a Jupyter notebook kernel, if you have installed the additional dependencies with `[all]` you can run:

```bash
uv run ipython kernel install --user --env VIRTUAL_ENV $(pwd)/.venv --name=archimedes
```

This will create a kernel named `archimedes` - you can change the name to whatever you'd like.

### Source installation

To install from source locally (e.g. for development or building the docs), the recommended procedure is to create a UV virtual environment as described above and then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinetreelabs/archimedes.git
cd archimedes

# Install the package with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
uv sync --all-extras
```

# Testing and development

Development standards outlined in the [testing guide](dev/TESTING.md) include:

- 100% code coverage
- Ruff formatting
- MyPy static type checking
- Vulnerability scanning with `pip-audit`
- Static analysis for security issues using [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/)
- Licensing compliance with [REUSE](https://reuse.software/)
