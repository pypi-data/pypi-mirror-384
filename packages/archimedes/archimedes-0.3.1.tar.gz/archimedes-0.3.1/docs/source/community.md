# Community

Thank you for your interest in Archimedes! We're excited to build a community around this project.

That said, at this early stage of development, bandwidth is highly constrained, so please be patient if you reach out or file an issue and you don't hear back right away.

## GitHub issues and pull requests

A couple of notes on GitHub:

- **We welcome issue reports** for bugs, documentation improvements, and feature requests
- **We are not currently accepting pull requests** as we establish the project's foundation and processes
- **We encourage discussions** in our GitHub Discussions area for questions, use cases, and general feedback

To reiterate, the [Discussions](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/discussions) page is the best place to go for general comments, questions, high-level requests or use cases.
At least for now, we'll be using this as the community hub, so feel free to share anything you've done with Archimedes, any challenges you've found, or what you're hoping to do next!
As we develop more outreach and social media, we'll try to highlight the coolest user projects (if you're open to it).

## RFC process

While we do have a [roadmap](roadmap.md) in mind, many details of it have not been solidified.
The main roadmap items are related to:

1. Simulation framework
2. Physics modeling
3. Path to hardware

We're hoping to solicit feedback from interested users about these, especially physics modeling and hardware support.

In the future we hope to have a more formal "request for comments" (RFC) process, but for now, if you have any thoughts on future development, please feel free to post on the [Discussions](https://github.com/PineTreeLabs/archimedes/discussions) page with the "RFC" tag.

We'd especially like to hearing from you if you'd be interested in using Archimedes for any of the following:

* HIL testing
* Deployment to embedded systems
* Model-predictive control on hardware
* Flight vehicle modeling
* Robotics modeling and control


## Support

Here's how you can get involved and support the project at this stage:

- **‚≠ê Star the Repository**: The simplest way to show support and help others discover the project
- **üêõ Report Issues**: Detailed bug reports, documentation gaps, and feature requests are invaluable
- **üí¨ Join Discussions**: Share your use cases, ask questions, or provide feedback in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pinetreelabs/archimedes/discussions)
- **üì¢ Spread the Word**: Tell colleagues, mention us in relevant forums, or share on social media
- **üìù Document Use Cases**: Share how you're using (or planning to use) Archimedes

If you've built something with Archimedes or are planning to, we definitely want to hear about it! Your real-world use cases directly inform our development priorities.

Besides the GitHub-based community support process, we may also have some capacity for more hands-on consulting and support, depending on the project and the scope.
