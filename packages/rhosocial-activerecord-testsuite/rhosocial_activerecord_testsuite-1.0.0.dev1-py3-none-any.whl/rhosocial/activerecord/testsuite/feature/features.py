"""Database feature constants and support system."""

# This file is deprecated in favor of the capability system defined in
# src/rhosocial/activerecord/backend/capabilities.py
#
# The new capability system provides:
# 1. A hierarchical structure for organizing capabilities
# 2. Type-safe enums with bit flags for efficient checking
# 3. A single source of truth in the backend modules
# 4. Direct integration with backend instances
#
# Please use the capability system instead of this feature system.
