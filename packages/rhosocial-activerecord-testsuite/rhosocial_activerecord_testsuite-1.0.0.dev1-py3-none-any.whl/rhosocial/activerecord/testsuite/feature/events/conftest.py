"""
This file defines the pytest fixtures for the "events" feature test group.

Fixtures are a core concept in pytest. They are functions that provide a fixed
baseline state or data for tests. In this case, they provide fully configured
ActiveRecord model classes that are ready to be used in tests.

The key mechanism here is `pytest.fixture` parameterization. The fixtures are
parameterized by the list of "scenarios" provided by the backend's provider.
This causes pytest to run each test that uses one of these fixtures multiple times,
once for each database configuration (scenario) the backend supports.
