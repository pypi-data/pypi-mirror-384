"""
This file defines the generic ActiveRecord model classes used by the mixins tests.

These models are "generic" because they define the data structure and validation
rules (using Pydantic), but they are not tied to any specific database backend.
The backend-specific provider is responsible for taking these classes and
configuring them with a live database connection at test time.
