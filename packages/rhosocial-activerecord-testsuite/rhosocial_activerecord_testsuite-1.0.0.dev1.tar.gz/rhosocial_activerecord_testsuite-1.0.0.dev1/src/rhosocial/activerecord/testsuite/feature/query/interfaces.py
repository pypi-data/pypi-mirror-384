"""
This file defines the interface (or contract) that a backend's test provider
must adhere to for the \"query\" feature group.

By defining a standard interface, the generic tests in the testsuite can rely on
these methods being available, regardless of which database backend is actually
running the tests. Each backend must provide a concrete class that implements
these abstract methods.
