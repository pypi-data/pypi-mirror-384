# Real-world Scenarios

This directory contains tests that simulate complex, real-world application scenarios. These tests verify that backends can handle intricate business logic and maintain data integrity under realistic conditions.

## Purpose

Real-world scenario tests go beyond individual feature validation to ensure that multiple components work together correctly in practical applications. These tests typically involve:

- Complex data relationships and cascading operations
- Multi-step business processes
- Concurrent access patterns
- Data integrity validation across related models
- Performance under realistic workloads

## Example Scenarios

### Blog/Forum System
- User registration and profile management
- Post creation with tags, categories, and media attachments
- Comment threads with nested replies
- Content moderation workflows
- Search functionality across posts and comments
- User following and notification systems

### E-commerce Platform
- Product catalog with variants, inventory, and pricing
- Shopping cart and checkout processes
- Order processing with status transitions
- Payment integration and transaction handling
- User reviews and ratings
- Inventory management and restocking workflows

### Business Intelligence/Analytics
- Data aggregation from multiple sources
- Time-series data processing and reporting
- Complex analytical queries with joins and groupings
- Dashboard data preparation
- Export functionality in various formats
- Real-time analytics with streaming data

### Content Management System
- Multi-level page hierarchy with permissions
- Media library with metadata and transformations
- Workflow approvals for content publishing
- SEO optimization tools
- Multi-language content support
- Audit trails for content changes

### Social Network Platform
- Friend/follower relationships with privacy controls
- News feed generation and personalization
- Messaging system with read receipts
- Event planning and RSVP management
- Group creation and management
- Real-time notifications

### Project Management Tool
- Task assignment with due dates and priorities

- Time tracking and billing integration
- File attachments and version control
- Team collaboration features
- Reporting and dashboard generation

## Structure

Currently, this directory is planned for real-world scenario tests but is not yet populated with specific test cases. Implementation will follow the same pattern as feature tests with appropriate fixtures and backend interfaces.

## Usage

Backend developers should ensure their implementations pass all real-world scenario tests to demonstrate production readiness. These tests are more comprehensive than feature tests and often require specific database configurations or setup procedures.
