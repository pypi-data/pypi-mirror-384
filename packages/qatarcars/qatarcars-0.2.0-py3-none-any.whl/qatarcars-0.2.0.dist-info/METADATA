# QatarCars ‚Äì Modern Passenger Cars Data

<img src="qatarcars_hex.png" data-fig-align="center" />

QatarCars is a lightweight CSV describing modern passenger cars from
around the world. The aim is to give students a small, well‚Äëstructured
dataset that still covers a range of data‚Äëscience tasks (merging,
filtering, statistics, machine‚Äëlearning). It was originally created in
2025 by Paul Musgrave and his International Politics statistics class at
Georgetown University. This package ports the dataset into Python and
allows users to decide whether to engage with the data as either a
`pandas` or `polars` dataframe. QatarCars is available in its original
form [as a csv](https://github.com/profmusgrave/qatarcars/tree/main), in
Stata, and as an [R Package](https://andrewheiss.github.io/qatarcars/).

## Installation

From pypi:

``` {bash}
pip install qatarcars
```

From GitHub:

``` {bash}
pip install git+https://github.com/prlitics/qatarcars.git
```

## What‚Äôs Included?

| Column | Description |
|:--:|----|
| origin | A string denoting nation of origin of the car |
| make | A string denoting the manufacturer/brand of the car |
| model | A string denoting the specific type of the car |
| length | A float denoting the car‚Äôs length (in meters) |
| width | A float denoting the car‚Äôs width (in meters) |
| height | A float denoting the car‚Äôs height (in meters) |
| seating | An integer denoting how many seats are within the car |
| trunk | An integer denoting the trunk‚Äôs volume (in liters) |
| economy | A float denoting how many liters of fuel is required to travel 100km |
| performance | A float denoting how many seconds it takes to accelerate to 100km/h from a dead stop |
| mass | A float of the car‚Äôs mass (in kg) |
| horsepower | An integer denoting the car‚Äôs horsepower |
| type | A string denoting the body-type of the car |
| enginetype | A string denoting the type of fuel/energy used by the engine |

### Polars or Pandas? You decide!

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is pretty much ubiquitous in Python
data analytics, often considered the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù implementation of a
dataframe. However, Polars is gaining in popularity because of its more
consistent and (especially comming to Python from R) intuitive syntax.
It‚Äôs also *very* fast, which can be great when dealing with large data.
However, the syntax of
[Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/index.html)
compared to Pandas is often quite different. So, for
pedagogical/learning purposes, I‚Äôve made it so that the core function
for the package `get_qatar_cars` can return either a pandas or polars
dataframe. It‚Äôs up to you!

## Examples

Let‚Äôs look at the first few observations. We‚Äôll visualize using
[`plotnine`](https://plotnine.org/) which is a great import of the
`ggplot2` package into Python.

``` python
from qatarcars import get_qatar_cars
import plotnine as p9

from qatarcars import get_qatar_cars
df = get_qatar_cars("pandas")   # or "polars"

df.head()
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }
&#10;    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
&#10;    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>

|  | origin | make | model | length | width | height | seating | trunk | economy | horsepower | price | mass | performance | type | enginetype |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | Germany | BMW | 3 Series Convertible | 4.713 | 1.827 | 1.440 | 5 | 480 | 11.8 | 184 | 190300 | 1777 | 5.8 | Coupe | Petrol |
| 1 | Germany | BMW | 3 Series Sedan | 4.713 | 1.827 | 1.440 | 5 | 59 | 7.6 | 386 | 164257 | 1653 | 4.3 | Sedan | Petrol |
| 2 | Germany | BMW | X1 | 4.505 | 1.845 | 1.642 | 5 | 505 | 6.6 | 313 | 264000 | 1701 | 5.4 | SUV | Petrol |
| 3 | Germany | Audi | RS Q8 | 5.012 | 1.694 | 1.998 | 5 | 605 | 12.1 | 600 | 630000 | 2490 | 3.6 | SUV | Petrol |
| 4 | Germany | Audi | RS3 | 4.542 | 1.851 | 1.412 | 5 | 321 | 8.7 | 400 | 310000 | 1565 | 3.8 | Sedan | Petrol |

I‚Äôm curious how much a vehicle‚Äôs weight impacts its ability to get to
100 km/hr from a dead stop?

``` python
(p9.ggplot(df) +
p9.aes(x = 'mass', y = 'performance') +
p9.geom_point() +
p9.geom_smooth() +
p9.labs(x = 'Mass (kg)', y = 'Time to 100km/h \n(seconds)'))
```

<img src="README_files/figure-commonmark/cell-3-output-1.png"
width="336" height="240" />

Does this change based on what kind of drivetrain it has?

``` python
(p9.ggplot(df) +
p9.aes(x = 'mass', y = 'performance', group = 'enginetype', color = 'enginetype') +
p9.geom_point() +
p9.geom_smooth() +
p9.labs(x = 'Mass (kg)', y = 'Time to 100km/h \n(seconds)'))
```

width="336" height="240" />

Interesting! Electric cars take more of a performance hit the heavier
they get whereas hybrids and petrol-based vehicles tend to flatten out
in their performance.

Let‚Äôs check out the distribution of cars by body type in the dataset.

``` python
(p9.ggplot(df) +
p9.aes(x = 'type') +
p9.geom_bar())
```

A lot of SUVs!

Have fun! üöó
