## Background

The first step in the translation process is to parse the PDF document and create an intermediate layer (IL) representation. This step involves extracting text, styles, formulas, and layout information from the PDF while maintaining their relationships and properties.

## Goal

1. Extract text content while preserving character-level information
2. Maintain font and style information
3. Preserve document structure and layout
4. Handle special elements like XObjects and graphics
5. Create a structured intermediate representation for later processing

## Specific Implementation

The parsing process consists of several key components working together:

### Step 1: PDF Interpreter (PDFPageInterpreterEx)

1. Page content processing:
   - Parse PDF operators and their parameters
   - Handle graphics state operations
   - Process text and font operations
   - Manage XObject rendering

2. Graphics filtering:
   - Filter non-formula lines
   - Handle color space operations
   - Process stroke and fill operations

3. XObject handling:
   - Process form XObjects
   - Handle image XObjects
   - Maintain XObject hierarchy

### Step 2: PDF Converter (PDFConverterEx)

1. Character processing:
   - Extract character information
   - Maintain character positions
   - Preserve style attributes

2. Layout management:
   - Handle page boundaries
   - Process figure elements
   - Manage coordinate systems

3. Font handling:
   - Map font identifiers
   - Process font metadata
   - Handle CID fonts

### Step 3: Intermediate Layer Creator (ILCreater)

1. Document structure creation:
   - Build page hierarchy
   - Create character objects
   - Maintain font registry

2. Resource management:
   - Process font resources
   - Handle color spaces
   - Manage graphic states

3. XObject tracking:
   - Track XObject hierarchy
   - Maintain XObject states
   - Process form content

### Step 4: High-level Coordination

1. Process management:
   - Initialize resources
   - Coordinate component interactions
   - Handle progress tracking

2. Resource initialization:
   - Set up font management
   - Initialize graphics resources
   - Prepare document structure

3. Error handling:
   - Handle malformed content
   - Manage resource errors
   - Provide debug information

## Additional Features

1. Font management:
   - Support for CID fonts
   - Font metadata extraction
   - Font mapping capabilities

2. Graphics state tracking:
   - Color space management
   - Line style preservation
   - Transparency handling

3. Coordinate system handling:
   - Support for transformations
   - Boundary box calculations
   - Position normalization

4. Debug support:
   - Detailed logging
   - Intermediate file generation
   - Progress tracking

## Limitations

1. Complex PDF features:
   - Limited support for some PDF extensions
   - Simplified graphics model
   - Basic transparency support

2. Font handling:
   - Limited support for some font formats
   - Simplified font metrics
   - Basic font feature support

3. Performance considerations:
   - Memory usage for large documents
   - Processing time for complex layouts
   - Resource management overhead

## Configuration Options

The parsing process can be customized through `TranslationConfig`:

1. `debug`: Enable/disable debug mode and intermediate file generation
2. Font-related settings:
   - Font mapping configurations
   - CID font handling options
3. Layout processing options:
   - Page selection
   - Content filtering rules
