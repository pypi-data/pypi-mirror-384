# SPEC-16: MCP Cloud Service Consolidation

## Why

### Original Architecture Constraints (Now Removed)

The current architecture deploys MCP Gateway and Cloud Service as separate Fly.io apps:

**Current Flow:**
```
LLM Client → MCP Gateway (OAuth) → Cloud Proxy (JWT + header signing) → Tenant API (JWT + header validation)
            apps/mcp                apps/cloud /proxy                    apps/api
```

This separation was originally necessary because:
1. **Stateful SSE requirement** - MCP needed server-sent events with session state for active project tracking
2. **fastmcp.run limitation** - The FastMCP demo helper didn't support worker processes

### Why These Constraints No Longer Apply

1. **State externalized** - Project state moved from in-memory to LLM context (external state)
2. **HTTP transport enabled** - Switched from SSE to stateless HTTP for MCP tools
3. **Worker support added** - Converted from `fastmcp.run()` to `uvicorn.run()` with workers

### Current Problems

- **Unnecessary HTTP hop** - MCP tools call Cloud /proxy endpoint which calls tenant API
- **Higher latency** - Extra network round trip for every MCP operation
- **Increased costs** - Two separate Fly.io apps instead of one
- **Complex deployment** - Two services to deploy, monitor, and maintain
- **Resource waste** - Separate database connections, HTTP clients, telemetry overhead

## What

### Services Affected

1. **apps/mcp** - MCP Gateway service (to be merged)
2. **apps/cloud** - Cloud service (will receive MCP functionality)
3. **basic-memory** - Update `async_client.py` to use direct calls
4. **Deployment** - Consolidate Fly.io deployment to single app

### Components Changed

**Merged:**
- MCP middleware and telemetry into Cloud app
- MCP tools mounted on Cloud FastAPI instance
- ProxyService used directly by MCP tools (not via HTTP)

**Kept:**
- `/proxy` endpoint (still needed by web UI)
- All existing Cloud routes (provisioning, webhooks, etc.)
- Dual validation in tenant API (JWT + signed headers)

**Removed:**
- apps/mcp directory
- Separate MCP Fly.io deployment
- HTTP calls from MCP tools to /proxy endpoint

## How (High Level)

### 1. Mount FastMCP on Cloud FastAPI App

```python
# apps/cloud/src/basic_memory_cloud/main.py

from basic_memory.mcp.server import mcp
from basic_memory_cloud_mcp.middleware import TelemetryMiddleware

# Configure MCP OAuth
auth_provider = AuthKitProvider(
    authkit_domain=settings.authkit_domain,
    base_url=settings.authkit_base_url,
    required_scopes=[],
)
mcp.auth = auth_provider
mcp.add_middleware(TelemetryMiddleware())

# Mount MCP at /mcp endpoint
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path="/mcp", stateless_http=True)
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)

# Existing Cloud routes stay at root
app.include_router(proxy_router)
app.include_router(provisioning_router)
# ... etc
```

### 2. Direct Tenant Transport (No HTTP Hop)

Instead of calling `/proxy`, MCP tools call tenant APIs directly via custom httpx transport:

```python
# apps/cloud/src/basic_memory_cloud/transports/tenant_direct.py

from httpx import AsyncBaseTransport, Request, Response
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_http_headers
import jwt

class TenantDirectTransport(AsyncBaseTransport):
    """Direct transport to tenant APIs, bypassing /proxy endpoint."""

    async def handle_async_request(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        # 1. Get JWT from current MCP request (via FastMCP DI)
        http_headers = get_http_headers()
        auth_header = http_headers.get("authorization") or http_headers.get("Authorization")
        token = auth_header.replace("Bearer ", "")
        claims = jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})
        workos_user_id = claims["sub"]

        # 2. Look up tenant for user
        tenant = await tenant_service.get_tenant_by_user_id(workos_user_id)

        # 3. Build tenant app URL with signed headers
        fly_app_name = f"{settings.tenant_prefix}-{tenant.id}"
        target_url = f"https://{fly_app_name}.fly.dev{request.url.path}"

        headers = dict(request.headers)
        signer = create_signer(settings.bm_tenant_header_secret)
        headers.update(signer.sign_tenant_headers(tenant.id))

        # 4. Make direct call to tenant API
        response = await self.client.request(
            method=request.method, url=target_url,
            headers=headers, content=request.content
        )
        return response
```

Then override basic-memory's client before mounting MCP:

```python
# apps/cloud/src/basic_memory_cloud/main.py

from basic_memory.mcp import async_client
from basic_memory_cloud.transports.tenant_direct import TenantDirectTransport

# Override basic-memory's HTTP client with direct transport
async_client.client = httpx.AsyncClient(
    transport=TenantDirectTransport(),
    base_url="http://direct"
)

# Now mount MCP - tools will use direct transport
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)
```

**Key benefits:**
- No changes to basic-memory code
- Per-request tenant resolution via FastMCP DI
- Eliminates HTTP hop entirely (~50 lines of code)
- /proxy endpoint remains for web UI

### 3. Keep /proxy Endpoint for Web UI

The existing `/proxy` HTTP endpoint remains functional for:
- Web UI requests
- Future external API consumers
- Backward compatibility

### 4. Security: Maintain Dual Validation

**Do NOT remove JWT validation from tenant API.** Keep defense in depth:

```python
# apps/api - Keep both validations
1. JWT validation (from WorkOS token)
2. Signed header validation (from Cloud/MCP)
```

This ensures if the Cloud service is compromised, attackers still cannot access tenant APIs without valid JWTs.

### 5. Deployment Changes

**Before:**
- `apps/mcp/fly.template.toml` → MCP Gateway deployment
- `apps/cloud/fly.template.toml` → Cloud Service deployment

**After:**
- Remove `apps/mcp/fly.template.toml`
- Update `apps/cloud/fly.template.toml` to expose port 8000 for both /mcp and /proxy
- Update deployment scripts to deploy single consolidated app


## Basic Memory Dependency: Async Client Refactor

### Problem
The current `basic_memory.mcp.async_client` creates a module-level `client` at import time:
```python
client = create_client()  # Runs immediately when module is imported
```

This prevents dependency injection - by the time we can override it, tools have already imported it.

### Solution: Context Manager Pattern with Auth at Client Creation

Refactor basic-memory to use httpx's context manager pattern instead of module-level client.

**Key principle:** Authentication happens at client creation time, not per-request.

```python
# basic_memory/src/basic_memory/mcp/async_client.py
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, Timeout

# Optional factory override for dependency injection
_client_factory = None

def set_client_factory(factory):
    """Override the default client factory (for cloud app, testing, etc)."""
    global _client_factory
    _client_factory = factory

@asynccontextmanager
async def get_client():
    """Get an AsyncClient as a context manager.

    Usage:
        async with get_client() as client:
            response = await client.get(...)
    """
    if _client_factory:
        # Cloud app: custom transport handles everything
        async with _client_factory() as client:
            yield client
    else:
        # Default: create based on config
        config = ConfigManager().config
        timeout = Timeout(connect=10.0, read=30.0, write=30.0, pool=30.0)

        if config.cloud_mode_enabled:
            # CLI cloud mode: inject auth when creating client
            from basic_memory.cli.auth import CLIAuth

            auth = CLIAuth(
                client_id=config.cloud_client_id,
                authkit_domain=config.cloud_domain
            )
            token = await auth.get_valid_token()

            if not token:
                raise RuntimeError(
                    "Cloud mode enabled but not authenticated. "
                    "Run 'basic-memory cloud login' first."
                )

            # Auth header set ONCE at client creation
            async with AsyncClient(
                base_url=f"{config.cloud_host}/proxy",
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
                timeout=timeout
            ) as client:
                yield client
        else:
            # Local mode: ASGI transport
            async with AsyncClient(
                transport=ASGITransport(app=fastapi_app),
                base_url="http://test",
                timeout=timeout
            ) as client:
                yield client
```

**Tool Updates:**
```python
# Before: from basic_memory.mcp.async_client import client
from basic_memory.mcp.async_client import get_client

async def read_note(...):
    # Before: response = await call_get(client, path, ...)
    async with get_client() as client:
        response = await call_get(client, path, ...)
        # ... use response
```

**Cloud Usage:**
```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from basic_memory.mcp import async_client

@asynccontextmanager
async def tenant_direct_client():
    """Factory for creating clients with tenant direct transport."""
    client = httpx.AsyncClient(
        transport=TenantDirectTransport(),
        base_url="http://direct",
    )
    try:
        yield client
    finally:
        await client.aclose()

# Before importing MCP tools:
async_client.set_client_factory(tenant_direct_client)

# Now import - tools will use our factory
import basic_memory.mcp.tools
```

### Benefits
- **No module-level state** - client created only when needed
- **Proper cleanup** - context manager ensures `aclose()` is called
- **Easy dependency injection** - factory pattern allows custom clients
- **httpx best practices** - follows official recommendations
- **Works for all modes** - stdio, cloud, testing

### Architecture Simplification: Auth at Client Creation

**Key design principle:** Authentication happens when creating the client, not on every request.

**Three modes, three approaches:**

1. **Local mode (ASGI)**
   - No auth needed
   - Direct in-process calls via ASGITransport

2. **CLI cloud mode (HTTP)**
   - Auth token from CLIAuth (stored in ~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json)
   - Injected as default header when creating AsyncClient
   - Single auth check at client creation time

3. **Cloud app mode (Custom Transport)**
   - TenantDirectTransport handles everything
   - Extracts JWT from FastMCP context per-request
   - No interaction with inject_auth_header() logic

**What this removes:**
- `src/basic_memory/mcp/tools/headers.py` - entire file deleted
- `inject_auth_header()` calls in all request helpers (call_get, call_post, etc.)
- Per-request header manipulation complexity
- Circular dependency concerns between async_client and auth logic

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Simpler request helper functions
- Auth happens at the right layer (client creation)
- Cloud app transport is completely independent

### Refactor Summary

This refactor achieves:

**Simplification:**
- Removes ~100 lines of per-request header injection logic
- Deletes entire `headers.py` module
- Auth happens once at client creation, not per-request

**Decoupling:**
- Cloud app's custom transport is completely independent
- No interaction with basic-memory's auth logic
- Each mode (local, CLI cloud, cloud app) has clean separation

**Better Design:**
- Follows httpx best practices (context managers)
- Proper resource cleanup (client.aclose() guaranteed)
- Easier testing via factory injection
- No circular import risks

**Three Distinct Modes:**
1. Local: ASGI transport, no auth
2. CLI cloud: HTTP transport with CLIAuth token injection
3. Cloud app: Custom transport with per-request tenant routing

### Implementation Plan Summary
1. Create branch `async-client-context-manager` in basic-memory
2. Update `async_client.py` with context manager pattern and CLIAuth integration
3. Remove `inject_auth_header()` from all request helpers
4. Delete `src/basic_memory/mcp/tools/headers.py`
5. Update all MCP tools to use `async with get_client() as client:`
6. Update CLI commands to use context manager and remove manual auth
7. Remove `api_url` config field
8. Update tests
9. Update basic-memory-cloud to use branch: `basic-memory @ git+https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory.git@async-client-context-manager`

Detailed breakdown in Phase 0 tasks below.

### Implementation Notes

**Potential Issues & Solutions:**

1. **Circular Import** (async_client imports CLIAuth)
   - **Risk:** CLIAuth might import something from async_client
   - **Solution:** Use lazy import inside `get_client()` function
   - **Already done:** Import is inside the function, not at module level

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - **Risk:** Tests using module-level client will break
   - **Solution:** Update fixtures to use factory pattern
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     @pytest.fixture
     def mock_client_factory():
         @asynccontextmanager
         async def factory():
             async with AsyncClient(...) as client:
                 yield client
         return factory
     ```

3. **Performance**
   - **Risk:** Creating client per tool call might be expensive
   - **Reality:** httpx is designed for this pattern, connection pooling at transport level
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor performance, can optimize later if needed

4. **CLI Cloud Commands Edge Cases**
   - **Risk:** Token expires mid-operation
   - **Solution:** CLIAuth.get_valid_token() already handles refresh
   - **Validation:** Test cloud login → use tools → token refresh flow

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Risk:** External code importing `client` directly
   - **Solution:** Keep `create_client()` and `client` for one version, deprecate
   - **Timeline:** Remove in next major version

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Create feature branch `consolidate-mcp-cloud`
2. Update basic-memory async_client.py for direct ProxyService calls
3. Update apps/cloud/main.py to mount MCP

### Phase 2: Testing
1. Local testing with consolidated app
2. Deploy to development environment
3. Run full test suite
4. Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. Deploy to development
2. Validate all functionality
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for issues

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Remove apps/mcp directory
2. Update documentation
3. Update deployment scripts
4. Archive old MCP deployment configs

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert feature branch
2. Redeploy separate apps/mcp and apps/cloud services
3. Restore previous fly.toml configurations
4. Document issues encountered

The well-organized code structure makes splitting back out feasible if future scaling needs diverge.

## How to Evaluate

### 1. Functional Testing

**MCP Tools:**
- [ ] All 17 MCP tools work via consolidated /mcp endpoint
- [ ] OAuth authentication validates correctly
- [ ] Tenant isolation maintained via signed headers
- [ ] Project management tools function correctly

**Cloud Routes:**
- [ ] /proxy endpoint still works for web UI
- [ ] /provisioning routes functional
- [ ] /webhooks routes functional
- [ ] /tenants routes functional

**API Validation:**
- [ ] Tenant API validates both JWT and signed headers
- [ ] Unauthorized requests rejected appropriately
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified

### 2. Performance Testing

**Latency Reduction:**
- [ ] Measure MCP tool latency before consolidation
- [ ] Measure MCP tool latency after consolidation
- [ ] Verify reduction from eliminated HTTP hop (expected: 20-50ms improvement)

**Resource Usage:**
- [ ] Single app uses less total memory than two apps
- [ ] Database connection pooling more efficient
- [ ] HTTP client overhead reduced

### 3. Deployment Testing

**Fly.io Deployment:**
- [ ] Single app deploys successfully
- [ ] Health checks pass for consolidated service
- [ ] No apps/mcp deployment required
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly

**Local Development:**
- [ ] `just setup` works with consolidated architecture
- [ ] Local testing shows MCP tools working
- [ ] No regression in developer experience

### 4. Security Validation

**Defense in Depth:**
- [ ] Tenant API still validates JWT tokens
- [ ] Tenant API still validates signed headers
- [ ] No access possible with only signed headers (JWT required)
- [ ] No access possible with only JWT (signed headers required)

**Authorization:**
- [ ] Users can only access their own tenant data
- [ ] Cross-tenant requests rejected
- [ ] Admin operations require proper authentication

### 5. Observability

**Telemetry:**
- [ ] OpenTelemetry traces span across MCP → ProxyService → Tenant API
- [ ] Logfire shows consolidated traces correctly
- [ ] Error tracking and debugging still functional
- [ ] Performance metrics accurate

**Logging:**
- [ ] Structured logs show proper context (tenant_id, operation, etc.)
- [ ] Error logs contain actionable information
- [ ] Log volume reasonable for single app

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: All MCP tools and Cloud routes work identically to before
2. **Performance**: Measurable latency reduction (>20ms average)
3. **Cost**: Single Fly.io app instead of two (50% infrastructure reduction)
4. **Security**: Dual validation maintained, no security regression
5. **Deployment**: Simplified deployment process, single app to manage
6. **Observability**: Telemetry and logging work correctly



## Notes

### Future Considerations

- **Independent scaling**: If MCP and Cloud need different scaling profiles in future, code organization supports splitting back out
- **Regional deployment**: Consolidated app can still be deployed to multiple regions
- **Edge caching**: Could add edge caching layer in front of consolidated service

### Dependencies

- SPEC-9: Signed Header Tenant Information (already implemented)
- SPEC-12: OpenTelemetry Observability (telemetry must work across merged services)

### Related Work

- basic-memory v0.13.x: MCP server implementation
- FastMCP documentation: Mounting on existing FastAPI apps
- Fly.io multi-service patterns
