edit_note("project-planning", "append", "\n## New Requirements\n- Feature X\n- Feature Y")

# Prepend timestamps to meeting notes
edit_note("meeting-notes", "prepend", "## 2025-05-27 Update\n- Progress update...")

# Replace specific sections under headers
edit_note("api-spec", "replace_section", "New implementation details", section="## Implementation")

Fixes #36 by modifying entity_service.update_entity() to read existing frontmatter from files before
  updating them. Custom metadata fields such as Status, Priority, and Version are now preserved when
  notes are updated through the write_note MCP tool.

Fixes #36 by modifying entity_service.update_entity() to read existing frontmatter from files before
  updating them. Custom metadata fields such as Status, Priority, and Version are now preserved when
  notes are updated through the write_note MCP tool.

Added test case that verifies this behavior by creating a note with custom frontmatter and then
  updating it.
