  TEXT: >
    The Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission includes the Active Link
    for Real-Time (I-ALiRT) system, which provides continuous, low-latency space weather data.
    I-ALiRT broadcasts real-time measurements from IMAP via NASAâ€™s Deep Space Network and
    international ground stations. It has data from 5 of the IMAP instruments:
    SWE (Solar Wind Electron), CoDICE (Compact Dual Ion Composition Experiment),
    HIT (High-energy Ion Telescope), MAG (Magnetometer),
    and SWAPI (Solar Wind and Pickup Ion).
    See https://imap.princeton.edu for more details.
