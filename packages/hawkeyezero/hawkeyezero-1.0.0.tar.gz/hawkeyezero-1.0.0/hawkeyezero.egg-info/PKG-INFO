Summary: Hawkeye-Zero - special trained model to detect 11 diffrent types of space debris. The idea wasn’t to build a perfect system — just to explore how far object detection can go in real-world space debris applications. Also very important thing was to care about easy and quick access to use model functions and data, so I've created special structure for this project to allowed developers to use model in diffrent environments in API's or as a simple python tool.

Hawkeye-Zero - special trained model to detect 11 diffrent types of space debris. 
The idea wasn’t to build a perfect system — just to explore how far object detection can go in real-world space debris applications.
It’s still early, but the results are promising. The model's trained on YOLO11 model created from ultralytics. Also very important thing was to care about easy and quick access to use model functions and data, so I've created special structure for this project to allowed developers to use model in diffrent environments in API's or as a simple python tool.
