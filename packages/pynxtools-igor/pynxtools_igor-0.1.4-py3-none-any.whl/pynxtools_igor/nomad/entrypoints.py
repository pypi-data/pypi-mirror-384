        This example presents the capabilities of the NOMAD platform to convert and
        and standardize data stored with Wavemetrics [Igor Pro](https://www.wavemetrics.com/) into the
        [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) format.

        It contains two examples:
        - Converting Igor Binary Wave (.ibw) and packed experiment  (.pxp) into NeXus files.
        - An example conversion of time-resolved resonant diffraction data into the standardized
          NeXus format for X-ray diffraction, [NXxrd](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/contributed_definitions/NXxrd.html).
