    "# Example for using the Igor reader\n",
    "The igor reader allows reading data from Wavemetrics Igor Pro .ibw \"binary wave\" files and .pxp \"packed experiment\" files. These two modes of operation are mutually exclusive, i.e. you can either pass one or multiple ibw files, or one pxp file. The behavior of the reader is controlled via two config files: ``config.json`` defines the assignment to nexus class paths, whereas ``entries.yaml.entry`` defines which data to read from the source file(s). This notebook showcases several examples how to use the reader. A more complete example and template how to convert complete datasets can be found in another example notebook. These examples convert to the nexus class ``NXroot``, the most generic Nexus class."
