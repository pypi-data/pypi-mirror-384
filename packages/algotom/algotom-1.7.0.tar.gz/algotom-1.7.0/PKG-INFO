           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### Data processing (**ALGO**)rithms for (**TOM**)ography.

![logo](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/logo2.png)

**Algotom** is a Python package designed for processing tomographic data. It offers a 
complete processing pipeline and workflow, including reading and writing data, pre-processing, 
tomographic reconstruction, post-processing, data simulation, and calibration techniques. 
The package provides numerous utility methods to assist users in constructing pipelines 
for processing their own data or developing new methods.

Key features of Algotom include a wide range of processing methods such as artifact removal, 
distortion correction, speckle-based phase-contrast imaging, and data reduction, as well as 
the capability to process non-standard tomography acquisitions such as grid or helical scans.

The software stands out for its readability, minimal dependencies, and rich documentation. 
Developed specifically for synchrotron-based tomographic beamlines, Algotom aims to maximize 
data quality, enhance workflow throughput, and fully exploit beamline capabilities.

Features
--------

Algotom is a lightweight package with minimal dependencies. The software is built 
on top of a few core Python libraries to ensure its ease-of-installation. Methods distributed in 
Algotom have been developed and tested at synchrotron beamlines where massive
datasets are produced. This factor drives the methods developed to be easy-to-use, 
robust, and practical. Algotom can be used on a normal computer to process large 
tomographic data. Some featuring methods in Algotom are as follows:

- Methods in a full data processing pipeline: reading-writing data, 
  pre-processing, tomographic reconstruction, and post-processing.
  
  ![pipe_line](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/data_processing_space.png) 
 
- Methods for processing grid scans (or tiled scans) with the offset rotation-axis 
  to multiply double the field-of-view (FOV) of a parallel-beam tomography system.
  These techniques enable high-resolution tomographic scanning of large samples.
  
  ![grid_scan](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/grid_scan.jpg)
  
- Methods for processing helical scans (with/without the offset rotation-axis).
  
  ![helical_scan](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/helical_scan.jpg)

- Methods for determining the center-of-rotation (COR) and auto-stitching images 
  in half-acquisition scans (360-degree acquisition with the offset COR).

- Practical methods developed and implemented for the package: zinger removal, 
  tilted sinogram generation, sinogram distortion correction, simplified form of Paganin's filter,
  beam hardening correction, DFI (direct Fourier inversion) reconstruction,
  FBP (filtered back-projection) reconstruction, BPF (back-projection filtering) reconstruction, 
  and double-wedge filter for removing sample parts larger than the FOV in a sinogram.
  
  ![pipe_line](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/double_wedge_filter.jpg)
  
- Utility methods for [customizing ring/stripe artifact removal methods](https://algotom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toc/section4/section4_3.html) 
  and parallelizing computational work.

- Calibration methods for helical scans and tomography alignment.

- Methods for generating simulation data: phantom creation, sinogram calculation
  based on the Fourier slice theorem, and artifact generation.
  
  ![simulation](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/simulation.png)

- Methods for phase-contrast imaging: phase unwrapping, speckle-based phase retrieval, image correlation, and image alignment.

  ![speckle](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/speckle_based_tomography.png)

- Methods for downsampling, rescaling, and reslicing (+rotating, cropping) 
  3D reconstructed image without large memory usage.

  ![reslicing](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/raw/master/figs/readme/reslicing.jpg)

- Direct vertical reconstruction for single slice, multiple slices, and multiple slices at 
  different orientations.

Installation
------------

- https://algotom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toc/section3.html
- If users install Algotom to an existing environment and Numba fails to install due to the latest Numpy:
  + Downgrade Numpy and install Algotom/Numba again.
  + Create a new environment and install Algotom first, then other packages.
  + Use conda instead of pip.
- Avoid using the latest version of Python or Numpy as the Python ecosystem taking time to keep up with these twos.

Usage
-----

- https://github.com/algotom/algotom/tree/master/examples

Development principles
----------------------

- While Algotom offers a complete set of tools for tomographic data processing covering 
  pre-processing, reconstruction, post-processing, data simulation, and calibration techniques;
  its development strongly focuses on pre-processing techniques. This distinction makes it a
  prominent feature among other tomographic software.   

- To ensure that the software can work across platforms and is easy-to-install; dependencies are minimized, and only 
  well-maintained [Python libraries](https://github.com/algotom/algotom/blob/master/requirements.txt) are used.

- To achieve high-performance computing and leverage GPU utilization while ensuring ease of understanding, usage, and software 
  maintenance, Numba is used instead of Cupy or PyCuda.

- Methods are structured into modules and functions rather than classes to enhance usability, debugging, and maintenance.

- Algotom is highly practical as it can run on computers with or without a GPU, multicore CPUs; and accommodates both small 
  and large memory capacities.
