        Finalizes the construction of the entity search configuration.

        This method prepares the builder to execute the collection by ensuring all necessary configurations are set and validates the overall integrity of the build. It should be called before executing the collection to ensure that the configuration is complete and valid.

        The build process involves checking that mandatory fields such as the device identifier are set. It also ensures that method calls that are incompatible with each other (like `build` and `build_execute`) are not both used.

        Example:
            builder.build()

        Returns:
            EntitiesSearchBuilder: Returns itself to allow for method chaining, enabling further actions like `execute`.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If required configurations are missing or if incompatible methods are used together.

        Note:
            This method should be used as a final step before `execute` to prepare the entities search configuration. It does not modify the state but ensures that the builder's state is ready for execution.

        Example:
            ~~~python
                builder.build()
            ~~~
