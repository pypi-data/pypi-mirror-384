              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Trollmoves

Trollmoves is a package providing software for file transfers.

The common nominator is the use of Posttroll messaging to make requests, and to
publish the completed transfers. These messages can be used to trigger further
processing.

The required libraries are listed for each of the parts below.

## Server/Client

Setup where one or more Server processes announce new files, and one or two
Client processes make transfer requests for the configured files.

### Trollmoves Server

Trollmoves Server is a process that follows a directory for new files, and publishes
a message when a matching file appears. If a Client makes a request for a file,
the file is transferred using one of the built-in movers (see below) based on the
destination given in the request.

Required libraries:
- ``netifaces``
- ``posttroll``
- ``pyzmq``
- ``trollsift``
- ``watchdog``

In addition, the required packages for the transfer protocol(s) to be used need to be
installed. See the mover documentation below for more details.

#### Running the server without a client
In some situations, it might be difficult to use the server/client architecture,
and thus there is a possibility to run the server in stand alone mode. To do
this, the only thing to do is omit the `request_port` configuration item in the
server configuration. From that point on, the server will send full uris in
the messages it publishes, along with a json representation of a `fsspec`
filesystem. From there, processes accepting these (eg `trollflow2`) will be able
to use `fsspec` to read and process the remote files.

### Trollmoves Client

Trollmoves Client is configured to subscribe to a specific topic, and to make requests
for matching files published by a Server. The destination of the file is given in
the request message. The Server handles the actual transfer.

Client can be configured to listen to multiple sources for the same files. The request
is made to the Server where the first announcement were received from.

Two clients can be configured to handle requests for a given data. This makes it possible
to make updates without outages, and in general add redundancy. One of the Client
processes is considered the primary, and the secondary will process the leftover
messages after a small (for example 0.2 s - 1 s) delay. The Clients communicate
which files are already handled, so duplicate transfers should not happen.

Required libraries:
- ``netifaces``
- ``posttroll``
- ``pyzmq``
- ``trollsift``

### Trollmoves Mirror

Trollmoves Mirror is a setup of back-to-back Server and Client that is used for
example to handle transfers from internal network to external Client processes. The
Mirror receives announcements from the internal network, publishes the file on
external network, and upon receiving a request handles the transfer from internal
Server to temporary directory and further on to the external destination.

Required libraries:
- ``netifaces``
- ``posttroll``
- ``pyzmq``
- ``trollsift``
- ``watchdog``

In addition, the required packages for the transfer protocol(s) to be used. See the
mover documentation below for more details.

## Trollmoves Dispatcher

Trollmoves Dispatcher can push files from local file system to any destination supported
by the built-in movers. The dispatching is triggered by Posttroll messages published
by a process creating the files, or otherwise following the arrival/creation of
files.

Required libraries:
- ``netifaces``
- ``posttroll``
- ``pyinotify``
- ``pyzmq``
- ``trollsift``

In addition, the required packages for the transfer protocol(s) to be used. See the
mover documentation below for more details.

## Individual movers

The individual movers can be used via the above listed processes, or used directly
in other applications. The movers can be imported from the ``trollmoves.movers``
module.

### ``FileMover``

``FileMover`` copies or moves a file between local filesystems.

Additional required packages: none.

### ``FtpMover``

``FtpMover`` transfers a local file to a FTP server.

Additional required packages: none.

### ``ScpMover``

``ScpMover`` uses SSH to transfer a local file to another (or the same) server.

Additional required packages:
- ``scp``
- ``paramiko``

### ``SftpMover``

``SftpMover`` uses SFTP protocol to transfer a local file to an SFTP server.

Additional required packages:
- ``paramiko``

### ``S3Mover``

``S3Mover`` uploads a file to an S3 object storage.

Additional required packages:
- ``s3fs``

Special behaviour on destination filepath when using the S3Mover class:

If the destination prefix (~filepath) has a trailing slash ('/') the original
filename will be appended (analogous to moving a file from one directory to
another keeping the same filename).

If the destination prefix does not have a trailing slash the operation will be
analogous to moving a file from one directory to a new destination changing the
filename. The new destination filename will be the last part of the provided
destination following the last slash ('/').


## s3downloader

This module is able to download files from a s3 endpoint.

The s3downloader module need to get posttroll messages from eg. s3stalker from the pytroll-collectors module which announces new available files in a configured s3 bucket. The s3downloader then downloads these files.

Example config for the module is given in `examples/s3downloader-config.yaml`. If you use a `nameserver` with muliticast (nameserver default) you don't need to include the nameserver option nor the service name in the config. Opposite if you use nameserver without multicast.

Additional required packages:
- ``boto3``
- ``botocore``
