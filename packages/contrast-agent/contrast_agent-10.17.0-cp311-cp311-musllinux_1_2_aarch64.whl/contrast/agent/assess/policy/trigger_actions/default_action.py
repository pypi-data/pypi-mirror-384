    """
    Default action used to evaluate whether a trigger rule is violated

    Most trigger nodes simply need to determine whether any of the trigger node sources
    contain an UNTRUSTED range that isn't also covered by a mitigating tag. However,
    some nodes (e.g. some SSRF triggers) may require more sophisticated logic to
    determine whether the rule was violated. These nodes can specify custom actions
    that implement the necessary logic.

    Custom actions must implement (or inherit) the following four attributes:
        * is_violated
        * find_all_tag_ranges
        * find_any_tag_ranges
        * extract_source
        * unwind_source (boolean)
