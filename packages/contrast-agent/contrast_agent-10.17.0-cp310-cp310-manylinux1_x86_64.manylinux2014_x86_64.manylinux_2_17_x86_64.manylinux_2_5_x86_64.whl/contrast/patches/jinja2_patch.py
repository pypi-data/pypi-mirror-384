    This is essentially a custom repatch. Jinja2 has several reexports of a `concat`
    function, which is set to `"".join`. If any module containing this function is
    loaded before our string patches are applied, we miss the patch on this attribute.
    Normally, repatching solves this problem; however repatching here doesn't work for
    multiple reasons:
    - `"".join` is already bound. We don't currently have machinery for repatching bound
      functions.
    - Repatching only covers module-level attributes, but in some instances, this is a
      class attribute

    The simplest solution is to overwrite these references with `"".join` again, after
    string patches have been applied.

    There are many reexports / aliases for `concat`, and these change across different
    versions of Jinja2. We currently only have fixes for those that appear to be
    critical for dataflow, but it's not impossible that we'll have to add more in the
    future.
