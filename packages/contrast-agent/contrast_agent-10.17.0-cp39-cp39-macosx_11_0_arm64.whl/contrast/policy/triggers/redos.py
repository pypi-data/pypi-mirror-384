# This rule, like SSRF, has an accompanying action to enforce an extra level
# of assertion on the violation, so it may not always report, depending on the
# value reported.
# Like the propagation methods for Re::Match, it also requires custom patching
# to instrument properly.
# For all of these methods, ARG_0 is the pattern passed in to the re method,
# which we verify against the REDOS action for exploitability but we do not
# care about its origin so it doesn't matter if it's tracked.
