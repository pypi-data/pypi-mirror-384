    Do not instantiate this class; call `instrument_adapter` or subclass it.

    This class provides machinery to instrument a totally generic, PEP-249 compliant
    adapter. We only have a reference to the adapter module, and we can't make any
    assumptions about the existence of `adapter.Cursor`, since this is not guaranteed
    by the spec.

    We are only guaranteed the following:
    - the adapter has a `connection()` method, which returns an instance of Connection
    - the Connection object has a `cursor()` method, which returns an instance of Cursor
    - the Cursor has `execute()` and `executemany()` methods

    This requires a somewhat roundabout instrumentation strategy:
    - on the first call to adapter.connect(), we can instrument the Connection class
    - on the first call to Connection.cursor(), we can instrument the Cursor class
    - this lets us instrument Cursor.execute() and Cursor.executemany()

        This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses if necessary. It must

        determined. "database name" is different depending on the adapter. Often this is
        a URL, but it can also be a path (sqlite3).

        Takes the arguments from a call to connect() and extracts information for
        database inventory reporting. By default only works with kwargs - we expect this
        to be by far the most common case.

        This follows the conventions laid out in the footnotes of dbapi2:
        https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/#id48

        In SQLAlchemy, see create_connect_args() for each dialect to get an idea of how
        different adapters are used. Most, if not all, use kwargs. Some adapters support
        a DSN connection string, but that should be handled by subclasses (if at all).
