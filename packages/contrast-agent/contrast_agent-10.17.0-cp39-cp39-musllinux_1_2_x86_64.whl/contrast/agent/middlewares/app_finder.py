    Recursively search through the middleware chain of `app` for an
    application of type `orig_app_class`. Most WSGI/ASGI middlewares are implemented as
    classes and maintain a reference to their wrapped app as an attribute. This function
    makes a best effort to find this attribute on each successive middleware until it
    sees an instance of the desired class.

    This method is not intended to succeed every time, as it is based off of several
    assumptions that will not always be true. It needs only succeed often enough that
    customers rarely need to supply additional information to framework-specific
    middleware constructors.

    This delegates to _find_original_application to ensure that we don't get an extra
    @fail_loudly on each recursive call.
