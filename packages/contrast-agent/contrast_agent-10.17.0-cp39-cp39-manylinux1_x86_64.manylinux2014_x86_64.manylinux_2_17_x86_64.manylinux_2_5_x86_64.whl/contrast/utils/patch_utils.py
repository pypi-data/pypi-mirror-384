    Applies patches to modules that were already imported prior to agent startup

    Here's the problem: our patches don't get applied until after our
    middleware class is initialized. At this point it's likely that most (or
    all) application modules will have already been imported.

    If we patch the function `foo.bar.baz`, and an application module that was
    loaded prior to our patches imports it as `from foo.bar import baz`, then
    our patch will have no effect within that application module. This is
    because the application module has a reference to the *original* function,
    and that reference remains unchanged even after we apply a patch to the
    `foo.bar` module.

    On the other hand, if the application imports it as `from foo import bar`
    and uses it as `bar.baz()`, then our patches will work just fine. In this
    case, the application module has a reference to the *module itself*, which
    is where we apply our patch. This means that when the application calls
    `bar.baz()`, it will be calling the updated (patched) function.

    Incidentally, if the application imports as `from foo.bar import baz`, but
    this module is not loaded until *after* our patches have been applied, our
    patch will be effective. However, we have no control over the order of
    imports in an application.

    This function is designed to remedy the former case in order to make sure
    that our patches are effective regardless of how they are imported or the
    order in which they are imported by the application.

    Prior to calling this function, we make a record of every function that
    gets patched. After all patches are applied, this function iterates
    through all imported modules, which includes all modules that may have been
    imported before our patches were applied. We look for any instances of the
    original functions that need to be patched, and we replace them with the
    patches in those modules.
