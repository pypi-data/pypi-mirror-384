        # statements. This is because the logging module sometimes uses streams to
        # output logs, and these logging events can inadvertently cause additional
        # log output that we use for debugging within our assess code. We want to
        # prevent this from occurring. Part of the reason for this is that we now
        # instrument stream reads and writes, but we also are aware that StringIO
        # is implemented with a lot of string building under the hood.

        #    exists. This means that no meaningful dataflow should be able to take place
        #    within this function in the first place.
        # 2. The only actual dataflow in `from_db_value` occurs when formatting the
        #    exception message for its failure case. Even if tracked data somehow enters
        #    this function, we would only lose propagation into this exception message.
        #    It's unlikely this message would find its way to a trigger (xss is probably
        #    the only possibility, if http responses for server exceptions include
        #    unsanitized error messages, but this seems like a stretch).
