    Frozen modules are modules whose bytecode is built into the interpreter
    itself for performance reasons. All of the modules required at interpreter
    startup are frozen in newer versions of Python (i.e. >= 3.10+).

    Frozen modules do not have access to the source code of module members such
    as functions. This means that calls toinspect.getsource(<frozen-module-name>.<member-name>)
    will fail. Since we need the source in order to perform rewrites, we need a
    non-frozen version of the module. We can achieve this by loading the module
    again and returning the new module object.
