    Some functions in the subprocess module behave differently (from a security
    perspective) depending on several factors:
    - the value of the `shell` argument
    - whether arguments are passed as a string or as a list
    - if the command being executed is particularly dangerous (ie invokes a shell)

    If `shell` is explicitly set to True, all arguments are potentially vulnerable,
    whether they appear as a string or list.

    If `shell` is False (the default) and arguments are passed as a string, the entire
    string is potentially vulnerable. If arguments are passed as a list, only the first
    element is potentially vulnerable - unless the first element is a common shell
    command, in which case all arguments are potentially vulnerable.
