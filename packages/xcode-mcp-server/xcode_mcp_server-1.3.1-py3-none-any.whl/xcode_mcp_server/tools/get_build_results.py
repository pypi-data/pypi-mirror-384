    Get aggregated build errors and warnings from all builds since the last clean operation.

    This tool addresses the issue where incremental builds only show warnings for recompiled files.
    It parses the build log manifest (LogStoreManifest.plist) and aggregates warnings from all
    builds since the last clean, excluding warnings from files that were subsequently recompiled.

    Strategy:
    1. Locate the project's DerivedData/Logs/Build directory
    2. Parse LogStoreManifest.plist to find all builds since last clean
    3. For each build, parse the .xcactivitylog file to extract:
       - Warnings and errors with file/line/column/message
       - List of files compiled in that build
    4. Aggregate warnings, keeping only the most recent warning for each file
    5. If a file was recompiled in a later build, use warnings from that later build

    This ensures you see all current warnings even after incremental builds.

    Args:
        project_path: Path to an Xcode project or workspace directory
        max_warnings: Maximum number of warnings to show in response (default 50)

    Returns:
