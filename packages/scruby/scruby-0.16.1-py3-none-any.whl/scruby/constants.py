"""Constant variables.

The module contains the following variables:

- `DB_ROOT` - Path to root directory of database. `By default = "ScrubyDB"` (*in root of project*).
- `HASH_REDUCE_LEFT` - The length of the hash reduction on the left side.
    - `0` - 4294967296 branches in collection (by default).
    - `2` - 16777216 branches in collectionю
    - `4` - 65536 branches in collectionю
    - `6` - 256 branches in collection (main purpose is tests).
