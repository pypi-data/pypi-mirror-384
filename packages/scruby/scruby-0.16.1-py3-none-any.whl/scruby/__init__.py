"""Asynchronous library for building and managing a hybrid database, by scheme of key-value.

The library uses fractal-tree addressing and
the search for documents based on the effect of a quantum loop.

The database consists of collections.
The maximum size of the one collection is 16**8=4294967296 branches,
each branch can store one or more keys.

The value of any key in collection can be obtained in 8 steps,
thereby achieving high performance.

The effectiveness of the search for documents based on a quantum loop,
requires a large number of processor threads.
