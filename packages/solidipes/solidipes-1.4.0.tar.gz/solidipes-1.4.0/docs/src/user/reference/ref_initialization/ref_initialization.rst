.. _solidipes-init:
Initializing a Solidipes project
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To prepare a new Solidipes project, run the following command in the root of your project directory::

    solidipes init

This will create a new directory called ``.solidipes`` in your project root. This directory contains the following files:

- ``study_metadata.yaml``: You'll need to manually modify this file with data from your study.

- ``ignore.yaml``: This file contains a list of files and directories that should be ignored by Solidipes. You can add more files and directories to this list if you want.

This will also create a ``README.md`` and a ``DESCRIPTION.md`` file in your project root. Here you explain the workings of your project and what is is about respectively.

.. note::
    You should not manually modify the ``README.md`` file. This file is automatically generated using the ``DESCRIPTION.md`` and the ``study_metadata.yaml`` when running the webreport.

In case the study ``.solidipes`` was already created and contains a .empty file, run the following command to reinitialize it::

    solidipes init --force

It should now contain the study_metadata.yml file.
The ``study_metadata.yml`` file contains metadata about the study, such as the name of the study, the authors, the description, etc. You can edit this file to add or modify metadata about your study.


.. _ref-metadata:
Metadata
~~~~~~~~

The ``study_metadata.yaml`` file contains metadata about the study, such as the name of the study, the authors, the description, etc.
This file can be accessed manually or via the webreport.

Replace the empty placeholders, **''** and **[]**, with the information about your data.
For example::

    creators:
    - name: YOUR NAME
      affiliation: YOUR UNIVERSITY
    - name: NAME OF YOUR COLLEAGUE
      affiliation: UNIVERSITY OF YOUR COLLEAGUE
    description: Do not edit this field manually. It will be replaced by the content of DESCRIPTION.md.
    keywords:
    - keyword1
    - keyword2
    - keyword3
    language: eng
    license: cc-by-4.0
    title: THE TITLE OF YOUR PROJECT / THESIS / PAPER
    upload_type: dataset

.. hint::
    If you already have a DOI for this dataset, you can add it to the `study_metadata.yaml` file. Else it will be added automatically during the upload.
    For example::

        doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1234567

.. _ref-additional-relations:
Additional relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add additional relations to the metadata. For example, if you have a paper that is related to the dataset, you can add it to the metadata.

..
    TO DO (add information about the additional relations)

.. _ref-description:
Description of the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DESCRIPTION.md`` file contains a description of the study. The generated ``DESCRIPTION.md`` file must be edited to explain the project in more detail (i.e. similar to an abstract).
The ``README.md`` is then automatically generated when running ``solidipes report`` using the information in ``study_metadata.yaml`` and ``DESCRIPTION.md``.
