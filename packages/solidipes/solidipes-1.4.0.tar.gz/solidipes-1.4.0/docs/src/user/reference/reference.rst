Here you can find a more in depth explanation of the functionalities of Solidipes.

Although the Solidipes package was mainly constructed to be used via the web interface (see :ref:`starting-the-webreport`) it can also be used via the command line interface and modifying metadata files directly. To get help on the command line interface, simply run::

    solidipes --help
