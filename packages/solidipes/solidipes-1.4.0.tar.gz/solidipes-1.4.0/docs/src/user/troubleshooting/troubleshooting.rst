Troubleshooting
================

Below are some common problems that you may encounter when using the Solidipes with the command line interface or the web interface. If you encounter an error that is not listed here, please raise an issue on `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/solidipes/solidipes/-/issues>`_.


File loaded as binary
---------------------

When a file format is not recognized by Solidipes, it is loaded as a binary file by default, and displayed as such.
The list of existing Loaders and their associated supported file types are listed in the :ref:`developer <developer-guide>` section. If you wish to write custom Loaders and Viewers for your own file types, please refer to the :ref:`developer <developer-guide>` section.
