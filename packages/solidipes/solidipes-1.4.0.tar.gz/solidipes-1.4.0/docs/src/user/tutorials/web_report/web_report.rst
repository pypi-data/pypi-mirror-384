Starting the web interface
--------------------------

If you don't have any data yet, it is important to think about how you want to structure your data. This can later help for visualization, analysis and publication.
To make it easier for you, we have created a few templates that you can use to create your own project.

If you already have your data organized use the following steps to start a solidipes project.

.. tip::
    Place all of your data into a ``data`` directory in your project directory.


Create a new project directory and enter it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. raw:: html

	 <video width="100%" controls>
	 <source src="https://gitlab.renkulab.io/guillaume.anciaux/solidipes-documentation-videos/-/raw/master/data/final_videos/solidipes-initialise.mp4?ref_type=heads&inline=false" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>

|

::

        mkdir my_project
        cd my_project

Initialize Solidipes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

        solidipes init

This will create:

- ``.solidipes`` folder in your project directory. This directory contains all the information about your project.
- ``DESCRIPTION.md`` file with the description of the project/dataset (To be filled by you).
- ``README.md`` file, automatically generated, containing standard metadata concatenated with the description.

.. note::
    The ``README.md`` file is generated by Solidipes and should not be modified directly. Instead, descriptive information beyond the standard metadata should be put in ``DESCRIPTION.md``, while metadata can be filled with the web interface.



.. _web-report:
Launch the web interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. raw:: html

	 <video width="100%" controls>
	 <source src="https://gitlab.renkulab.io/guillaume.anciaux/solidipes-documentation-videos/-/raw/master/data/final_videos/solidipes-web-overview.mp4?ref_type=heads&inline=false" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>

You can **check the sanity of your data, visualize and describe your project** as well as **modify the meta data** in a web interface using the ``solidipes report web-report`` command.

This *Graphical User Interface* allows to:

- modify accordingly the ``study_metadata.yaml`` and ``DESCRIPTION.md`` files
- validate the sanity of the files in the dataset
- scrutinize the files for a visual control

Run::

        solidipes report web-report


Sharing
^^^^^^^
You project can be shared with other people online using a similar interface. Check the :ref:`sharing-with-renku` section for guidance.
