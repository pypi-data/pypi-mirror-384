## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install {{ package_name }}`

  or via pipenv:

  `pipenv install {{ package_name }}`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        "{{ module_name }}",
    )
    ```

Since this package adds only Django system checks, which don't run on production, you could add it only when being in
(local) debug mode.

```python
if DEBUG_MODE:
    INSTALLED_APPS += ("{{ module_name }}",)
```

{% if has_migrations %}
- Apply migrations by running:

  `python ./manage.py migrate`
{% endif %}
