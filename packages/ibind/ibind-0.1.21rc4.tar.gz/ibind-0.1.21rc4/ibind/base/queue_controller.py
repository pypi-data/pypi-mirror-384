    Provides access to a queue with an associated key.

    This class encapsulates a queue and provides methods to interact with it, such as retrieving items
    and checking if the queue is empty. It is generic and can be associated with a key of any type.

        Parameters:

        Attempts to retrieve an item from the queue.

        This method tries to get an item from the queue. If the queue is empty and 'block' is False,
        it immediately returns None. Otherwise, it blocks until an item is available or until the
        timeout (if provided in 'kwargs') elapses.

        Parameters:
            block (bool, optional): Whether to block if the queue is empty. Defaults to False.
            timeout (Optional[float]): The maximum time in seconds to block waiting for an item.
                                       A value of None indicates an indefinite wait. Only effective if 'block' is True.


        Returns:
            The item retrieved from the queue, or None if the queue is empty and 'block' is False.

class QueueController(Generic[T]):
    """
    A generic controller class for managing multiple queues, each identified by a unique key.

    This class is generic and can work with any type of key (T). It allows the creation and management
    of multiple queues, each associated with a unique key of type T. The class provides methods to
    register new queues, retrieve existing queues, and add data to queues based on their keys.

    Example Usage:
      - Using strings as keys:
        queue_controller = QueueController[str]()
        queue_controller.register_queues(['queue1', 'queue2'])
        queue_controller.put_to_queue('queue1', data)

      - Using integers as keys:
        queue_controller = QueueController[int]()
        queue_controller.register_queues([1, 2])
        queue_controller.put_to_queue(1, data)
