# Product Overview

## What is Tree-sitter Analyzer?

Tree-sitter Analyzer is a revolutionary code analysis tool designed specifically for the AI era. It solves the fundamental problem of LLM token limits when analyzing large code files.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Large code files (>10K lines) exceed LLM token limits, making AI-assisted code analysis impossible or inefficient.

**Solution**: Smart code analysis that provides:
- Code structure overview without reading entire files
- Precise line-range extraction of code sections
- Accurate positioning data for code operations
- Native AI assistant integration via MCP protocol

## Target Users

1. **AI Assistant Users**: Developers using Claude Desktop, Cursor, Roo Code, and other AI IDEs
2. **CLI Users**: Developers who prefer command-line tools for code analysis
3. **Enterprise Teams**: Organizations dealing with large codebases and AI-assisted development
