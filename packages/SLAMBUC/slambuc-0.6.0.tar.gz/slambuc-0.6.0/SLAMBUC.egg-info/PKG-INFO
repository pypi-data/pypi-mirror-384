Collection of graph partitioning algorithms implemented in Python for composing cloud-native
applications from standalone serverless functions in a cost-efficient and latency-constrained manner.

## Overview

In the context of serverless computing, function fusion is a novel, high-level approach to improve
performance and at the same time reduce the operational cost of serverless applications consisting
of stateless, ephemeral functions. This is achieved by grouping, encompassing, and assembling connected
FaaS functions into separate composite components representing the deployable software artifacts that
are provisioned by the serverless frameworks in the same way as other single functions.
In addition, different user-defined Quality of Service (QoS) constraints should be also taken into
account, e.g., overall response time of the application or an end-to-end latency constraint on the critical
path in the application's call graph.

Under the hood, this problem can be formalized as the partitioning of the application call graph (DAG)
into disjoint, connected subgraphs in a cost-efficient manner, while specific requirements imposed by
the user and the platform (flavors) itself need to be satisfied.

In this package, we designed, implemented, and collected various partitioning algorithms tailored to
tree-shape serverless applications with different runtime complexity, considering communication
parameters and requirements. Our main goal is to find the cost-optimal grouping of functions
concerning node and edge-weighted trees and cost/memory/latency models based on public cloud frameworks,
whereas each flavor imposes an upper limit on the available operative memory.
Moreover, a user-given latency constraint has to be fulfilled on the tree's critical path, which is
defined as the subchain between the first/front-end function and a predefined leaf node.

## Installation

### Environment

Our implementations require Python3.10 or above. The following code snippet can be used to set up the
latest Python environment on Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y 'ppa:deadsnakes/ppa' && sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.14 python3.14-dev
sudo curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python3.14
```

### SLAMBUC package

The easiest way to get our algorithms collected in [SLAMBUC](slambuc) is to install the package from
[PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/SLAMBUC/).

```bash
python3.14 -m pip install slambuc
```

However, for the latest changes, it can be installed directly from GitHub as follows.

```bash
python3.14 -m pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/hsnlab/SLAMBUC.git
```

Tree plotting relies on networkx's internal plotting feature that generates a layout based on the
[graphviz tool and its python frontend](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html).
Thus, in that case, the related dependencies must be installed first.

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
python3.14 -m pip install pygraphviz
```

External solvers can also be used in LP-based algorithms that require the given solver packages to be
preinstalled and available for the [PuLP frontend](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp). Currently,
the following solvers are tested.

* CBC (default, packaged with PuLP)
* GLPK (see installation [here](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/main/installing_pulp_at_home.html#linux-installation))
* CPLEX ([installation](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)
  and [setup](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/guides/how_to_configure_solvers.html#cplex))

It is worth noting that CPLEX's python wrapper [docplex](https://pypi.org/project/docplex/)
(as a replacement for PuLP) is left behind the latest Python version. For using this API, requirements
are prepared separately for **Python3.12**.

```bash
python3.12 -m pip install -U -r requirements_py3.12.txt
```

For solving constrained shortest path problems (CSP), we apply solution methods from
[cspy](https://github.com/torressa/cspy).

### Test harness and performance validation

Our repository contains separate test scripts under the [tests](tests) folder for validating the
input/output formats and call parameters. These codes also serve as examples for using the different
implementations of our package.

For comparative analyses, we also implemented a test harness under [validation](validation)
to automatize test executions with generated test input graphs from [validation/data](validation/data)
and monitor elapsed time and memory demands of tested algorithms initiated as separate subprocesses.

To install additional dependencies, run the following commands.

```bash
python3.14 -m pip install slambuc[tests]      # For executing tests
pathon3.14 -m pip install slambuc[validation] # For using our test harness framework
```

## Usage

Primarily, SLAMBUC is designed as a software package for a specific collection of graph
partitioning algorithms.

Refer to the wiki
for the
related [formats, execution parameters, examples, and API documentation](https://github.com/hsnlab/SLAMBUC/wiki).

### Example for direct import and invocation

```python
from slambuc.alg.tree.serial.pseudo import pseudo_ltree_partitioning
from slambuc.misc.random import get_random_tree

# Generate an example application call tree randomly
tree = get_random_tree(nodes=10)  # Assuming random memory demands are in GB
# Collect input parameters
params = dict(tree=tree,
              root=1,  # Root node ID
              M=6,  # Memory upper limit
              L=450,  # Latency upper limit
              cp_end=10,  # Critical path: [root -> cp_end]
              delay=10)  # Platform delay in ms

# Invoke a partitioning algorithm
res = pseudo_ltree_partitioning(**params)
print(f"Part: {res[0]}, opt. cost: {params['M'] * (res[1] / 1000)} GBs, latency: {res[2]} ms")
"Part: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9], [10]], opt. cost: 7.512 GBs, latency: 449 ms"
```

However, SLAMBUC also provide a full-featured [CLI](slambuc/tool/cli.py) for directly invoking
partitioning algorithms with

- an application call graph/chain serialized in a file, and
- algorithmic parameters defined as console arguments.

During installation a helper script, called `slambuc`, is installed for calling the command line interface.
However, the CLI can be invoked directly with `python3 -m slambuc` or `python3 -m slambuc.tool.cli`. E.g.:

```bash
$ slambuc -h
Usage: slambuc [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Serverless Layout Adaptation with Memory-Bounds and User Constraints (SLAMBUC).

Options:
  -j, --json     Output as valid JSON
  -s, --split    Split result into separate lines
  -q, --quiet    Suppress logging messages
  -v, --version  Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  chain  Sequence partitioning algorithms.
  dag    DAG partitioning algorithms.
  ext    External partitioning algorithms and heuristics.
  tree   Tree partitioning algorithms.

  See https://github.com/hsnlab/SLAMBUC for more details.
```

For the proper argument names and types, on which the CLI validates the given command line options,
check the internal help by calling any subcommand with the `-h` or `--help` flag. E.g.:

```bash
$ slambuc chain path dp --help
Usage: slambuc chain path dp [OPTIONS] FILENAME

  Cost-optimal partitioning based on (vectorized) dynamic programming.

Options:
  --alg [chain|vector]   Specific algorithm to be run  [default: vector]

  --unfold / --barriers  Return full blocks or barrier nodes only  [default: barriers]
  -h, --help             Show this message and exit.
```

### Example for tree partitioning from CLI

```bash
$ slambuc tree serial pseudo ./tests/data/graph_test_tree_random.gml  --root=1 --M=6 --L=450 --cp_end=10 --delay=10
Importing algorithm function: <pseudo_ltree_partitioning> from SLAMBUC module: <slambuc.alg.tree.serial.pseudo>
Loading input data from file: /home/czentye/projects/SLAMBUC/tests/data/graph_test_tree_random.gml
Parsed input:
  - tree: DiGraph named 'random_tree_1759849079.887418' with 11 nodes and 10 edges
Collected parameters:
  - root: 1
  - M: 6
  - L: 450
  - cp_end: 10
  - delay: 10
  - bidirectional: True
Executing partitioning algorithm...
  -> Algorithm finished successfully in 0.454337 ms!
Received FEASIBLE solution:
([[1, 3], [2, 4], [5], [6, 8, 9], [7], [10]], 953, 346)
```

### Input format

The CLI supports the following formats:
  - Graph as DAG:
    - networkx's standard [GML format](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/gml.html) (_*.gml_)
  - Graph as tree:
    - networkx's GML format (_*.gml_)
    - SLAMBUC's [own concise format](slambuc/misc/io) (_*.svt_, _*.npy_, _*csv_)
  - Sequence metrics as chain:
    - numpy's own format (_*.npy_, _*.npz_)
    - plain text format (_*.csv_)

For graph formats, SLAMBUC has some prerequirements, such as metrics must be integers, 
or graph has an entry node called `PLATFORM`.
Refer to the wiki for the related
[formats, execution parameters, examples, and API documentation](https://github.com/hsnlab/SLAMBUC/wiki).

To serialize networkx-based graph objects, the following code snippets bring examples in Python:
```python
from slambuc.misc.random import get_random_tree
from slambuc.misc.io import save_tree
import networkx as nx

tree = get_random_tree(10)
# networkx format
nx.write_gml(tree, 'example.gml')
# SLAMBUC format
save_tree(tree, 'example.svt')
# or
save_tree(tree, 'example.csv', raw=False)
```
The `.svt`, `.npy` extensions can be used for the `save_tree()` function as native formats, 
while `.csv` is primarily supported for plain text encoding.
fundamentally, this tree encoding format is based on the numpy vectors encompassing 
  - the tree's structure as its unique Prüfer sequence, and
  - node/edge metrics.

For more information, see the related inline document of the `encode_service_tree()` function
in `slambuc.misc.io`.

For serializing chain metrics as arrays of equal sizes, the `numpy` package can be used to easily 
store the metric arrays strictly following the order:
1. runtime
2. memory
3. rate
4. data (optional, depending on the called algorithm)

The following code snippets bring examples in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define metrics
runtime = [20, 40, 50, 20, 70, 40, 50, 60, 40, 10]
memory = [3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
rate = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3]

# Save as native numpy arrays
np.save('example_chain.npy', [runtime, memory, rate])
# Save in numpy's container format with corresponding keys
np.savez('example_chain.npz', runtime=runtime, memory=memory, rate=rate)
# Save in plain text CSV
np.savetxt('example_chain.csv', [runtime, memory, rate], delimiter=',', fmt='%i')
```

Example serialized inputs can be found under the [test folder](tests/data).

### Output format

The result is printed to the _standard output_ in the format: `<partitioning>`, `<cost>`, `<latency>`.
Basically, logs are write out to _standard error_, thus result can be easily processed programmatically by
parsing only the standard output. Nevertheless, `slambuc` can supress logs with the `-q` flag.

For easier output processing, the `-j` flag can be used to automatically convert the printed result,
that follows the Python's internal representation, into JSON format, while the flag `-s` splits the
results, either the triplets of one partitioning, or the multiple partitioning, of into separate lines.
For example,
```bash
$ slambuc -js tree layout ilp ./tests/data/graph_test_tree_ser.gml --cp_end=10 --flavor=3,2,1 --flavor=6,1,2 2>/dev/null
[[[1, 2], [6, 1, 2.0]], [[3, 4, 5], [3, 2, 1.0]], [[6, 8, 9], [3, 2, 1.0]], [[7], [6, 1, 2.0]], [[10], [3, 2, 1.0]]]
779.0
398.0
```
or
```bash
$ slambuc -s -j -q  tree path greedy ./tests/data/graph_test_tree_random.gml --cp_end=10 --L=500 --cuts --unit=10
[[[1, 3], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9, 10]], 890, 3]
[[[1, 3], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]], 890, 4]
[[[1, 2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9, 10]], 890, 4]
[[[1, 2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]], 890, 5]
[[[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9, 10]], 890, 4]
[[[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]], 890, 5]
```


### Example for chain partitioning from CLI

```bash
$ slambuc chain path dp ./tests/data/chain_test_sequence_serial.npz --M=6 --N=2 --L=500 --unit=100 --unfold
Importing algorithm function: <vec_chain_partitioning> from SLAMBUC module: <slambuc.alg.chain.path.dp>
Loading input data from file: /home/czentye/projects/SLAMBUC/tests/data/chain_test_sequence_serial.npz
Parsed input:
  - runtime: [20, 40, 50, 20, 70, 40, 50, 60, 40, 10]
  - memory: [3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
  - rate: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3]
Collected parameters:
  - M: 6
  - N: 2
  - L: 500
  - start: 0
  - end: None
  - delay: 1
  - unit: 100
  - unfold: True
Executing partitioning algorithm...
  -> Algorithm finished successfully in 0.463431 ms!
Received FEASIBLE solution:
([[0], [1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [6, 7, 8], [9]], 1200, 405)
```

CLI positional parameters follow SLAMBUC's [package structure](slambuc/alg), while most of the algorithmic parameters
that have default parameters adn can be defined via command line are exposed as optional parameters.

## Performance experiments

Validation results of a subset of our algorithms with a fully serialized block execution model,
which are executed with our [validation script](tests/validate_algs.py) using different configurations
and a [random-generated input call graph](tests/data/graph_test_tree_ser.gml) of size 10.

Used algorithmic parameters (if applicable):

* Root node ID (root): 1
* Memory limit (M): 6
* Available vCPU count (N): 1
* Critical path's end node ID (cp_end): 10
* Latency limit: (L): **500**
* Platform delay: (delay): 10
* Bidirectional elimination (bidirectional): True
* Cost approximation ratio (Epsilon): 0.0
* Latency violation ratio (Lambda): 0.0

One of the example tree with node/edge weights (execution time: **T**, memory: **M**, data R/W: **D**,
invocation rate: **R**) is depicted below:
![example_Tree](tests/data/valitdate_example_tree.png)
Exact algorithms are configured to yield all optimal solutions (if exists) with the numerating
format `{alg}_{num}`.
