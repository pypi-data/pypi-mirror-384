**This project provides a comprehensive and developer-friendly Python library for working with ONVIF-compliant devices.** It is designed to be reliable, easy to integrate, and flexible enough to support a wide range of ONVIF profiles and services.  

**[ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org) (Open Network Video Interface Forum)** is a global standard for the interface of IP-based physical security products, including network cameras, video recorders, and related systems.  

Behind the scenes, ONVIF communication relies on **[SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) (Simple Object Access Protocol)** — an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)-based messaging protocol with strict schema definitions ([WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language)/[XSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C))). SOAP ensures interoperability, but when used directly it can be verbose, complex, and error-prone.  

This library simplifies that process by wrapping SOAP communication into a clean, Pythonic API. You no longer need to handle low-level XML parsing, namespaces, or security tokens manually — the library takes care of it, letting you focus on building functionality.  

## Key Features
- Full implementation of ONVIF core services and profiles  
- Support for device discovery, media streaming, PTZ control, event management, and more  
- Pythonic abstraction over SOAP requests and responses (no need to handcraft XML)  
- Extensible architecture for custom ONVIF extensions  
- Compatible with multiple ONVIF specification versions  
- Example scripts and tests included  

## Who Is It For?
- **Individual developers** exploring ONVIF or building hobby projects  
- **Companies** building video intelligence, analytics, or VMS platforms  
- **Security integrators** who need reliable ONVIF interoperability across devices

## Usage Example

> [!TIP]
> You can view the complete documentation automatically generated by DeepWiki via the [onvif-python AI Wiki](https://deepwiki.com/nirsimetri/onvif-python) link. We currently do not have an official documentation site. Help us create more examples and helpful documentation by [contributing](https://github.com/nirsimetri/onvif-python?tab=contributing-ov-file).

Below are simple examples to help you get started with the ONVIF Python library. These demonstrate how to connect to an ONVIF-compliant device and retrieve basic device information.

**1. Initialize the ONVIFClient**

Create an instance of `ONVIFClient` by providing your device's IP address, port, username, and password:

```python
from onvif import ONVIFClient

client = ONVIFClient("192.168.1.17", 8000, "admin", "admin123")
```

**2. Create Service Instance**

`ONVIFClient` provides several main services that can be accessed via the following methods:

- `client.devicemgmt()` — Device Management
- `client.events()` — Events
- `client.imaging()` — Imaging
- `client.media()` — Media
- `client.ptz()` — PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom)
- `client.analytics()` — Analytics

and so on, check [Implemented ONVIF Services](https://github.com/nirsimetri/onvif-python?tab=readme-ov-file#implemented-onvif-services) for more details

Example usage:
```python
device = client.devicemgmt()      # Device Management (Core)
media = client.media()            # Media
```

**3. Get Device Information**

Retrieve basic information about the device, such as manufacturer, model, firmware version, and serial number using `devicemgmt()` service:

```python
info = device.GetDeviceInformation()
print(info)
# Example output: {'Manufacturer': '..', 'Model': '..', 'FirmwareVersion': '..', 'SerialNumber': '..'}
```

**4. Get RTSP URL**

Retrieve the RTSP stream URL for live video streaming from the device using `media()` service:

```python
profile = media.GetProfiles()[0]  # use the first profile
stream = media.GetStreamUri(
    ProfileToken=profile.token, 
	StreamSetup={"Stream": "RTP-Unicast", "Transport": {"Protocol": "RTSP"}}
)
print(stream)
# Example output: {'Uri': 'rtsp://192.168.1.17:8554/Streaming/Channels/101', ...}
```

<summary><b>Production Configuration</b></summary>

```python
from onvif import ONVIFClient, CacheMode

# Recommended production settings
client = ONVIFClient(
    host="your-cctv-node.viewplexus.com",
    port=443,
    username="admin",
    password="secure_password",
    timeout=15,
    cache=CacheMode.ALL,        # Maximum performance (default)
    use_https=True,             # Secure communication
    verify_ssl=True,            # Verify certificates (default)
    apply_patch=True,           # Enhanced parsing (default)
    capture_xml=False           # Disable debug mode (default)
)
```
</details>

### Notes

- **Authentication:** This library uses **WS-UsernameToken with Digest** authentication by default, which is the standard for ONVIF devices.
- **Patching:** The `apply_patch=True` (default) enables custom zeep patching that improves `xsd:any` field parsing. This is recommended for better compatibility with ONVIF responses.
- **XML Capture:** Only use `capture_xml=True` during development/debugging as it increases memory usage and may expose sensitive data in logs.
- **Cache Location:** Disk cache (when using `CacheMode.DB` or `CacheMode.ALL`) is stored in `~/.onvif-python/onvif_zeep_cache.sqlite`.

## Service Discovery: Understanding Device Capabilities

> [!WARNING]
> Before performing any operations on an ONVIF device, it is highly recommended to discover which services are available and supported by the device. This library automatically uses `GetServices` during initialization to discover service endpoints, but you can also query services manually for detailed information including capabilities.

**Why discover device services?**

- **Device Diversity:** Not all ONVIF devices support every service. Available services may vary by manufacturer, model, firmware, or configuration.
- **Error Prevention:** Attempting to use unsupported services can result in failed requests, exceptions, or undefined behavior.
- **Dynamic Feature Detection:** Devices may enable or disable services over time (e.g., after firmware updates or configuration changes).
- **Optimized Integration:** By checking available services, your application can adapt its workflow and UI to match the device's actual features.

**How service discovery works in this library:**

The `ONVIFClient` automatically calls `GetServices` during initialization to build a service map. This map is used internally to resolve service endpoints:

```python
from onvif import ONVIFClient

client = ONVIFClient("192.168.1.17", 8000, "admin", "admin123")

# Access the discovered services
print(client.services)
# Example output: [{'Namespace': 'http://www.onvif.org/ver10/device/wsdl', 'XAddr': '...', 'Version': {...}}, ...]

# Check the service map (namespace -> XAddr mapping)
print(client._service_map)
# Example output: {'http://www.onvif.org/ver10/media/wsdl': 'http://192.168.1.17:8000/onvif/Media', ...}
```

**Get detailed service information with capabilities:**

If you need detailed capability information for each service, call `GetServices` with `IncludeCapability=True`:

```python
device = client.devicemgmt()
services = device.GetServices(IncludeCapability=True)

for service in services:
    print(f"Service: {service.Namespace}")
    print(f"Endpoint: {service.XAddr}")
    print(f"Version: {service.Version.Major}.{service.Version.Minor}")
    if hasattr(service, 'Capabilities') and service.Capabilities:
        print(f"Capabilities: {service.Capabilities}")
```

**Alternative: Use GetCapabilities for legacy compatibility:**

For backward compatibility or when you need a quick overview of major service categories, you can still use `GetCapabilities`:

```python
capabilities = client.devicemgmt().GetCapabilities()
print(capabilities)
# Example output: {'Media': {'XAddr': '...', ...}, 'PTZ': {...}, 'Events': {...}, ...}
```

> [!TIP]
> The library handles service discovery automatically, so you typically don't need to call `GetServices` manually unless you need detailed capability information or want to refresh the service list after device configuration changes.

## Service Bindings in ONVIF

ONVIF services are defined by WSDL bindings. In this library, there are two main patterns:

### 1. Single Binding Services

Most ONVIF services use a single binding, mapping directly to one endpoint. These are accessed via simple client methods, and the binding/xAddr is always known from device capabilities.

<details>
<summary>Examples:</summary>

```python
client.devicemgmt()   # DeviceBinding
client.media()        # MediaBinding
client.ptz()          # PTZBinding
...
```

✅ These are considered fixed and always accessed directly.

</details>

### 2. Multi-Binding Services

Some ONVIF services have multiple bindings in the same WSDL. These typically include:
- A **root binding** (main entry point)
- One or more **sub-bindings**, discovered or created dynamically (e.g. after subscription/configuration creation)

<details>
<summary>Examples:</summary>

1. **Events**
   - **Root:** `EventBinding`
   - **Sub-bindings:**
     - `PullPointSubscriptionBinding` (created via `CreatePullPointSubscription`)
     - `SubscriptionManagerBinding` (manages existing subscriptions)
     - `NotificationProducerBinding`

   Usage in library:
   ```python
   client.events()                    # root binding
   client.pullpoint(subscription)     # sub-binding (dynamic, via SubscriptionReference.Address)
   client.subscription(subscription)  # sub-binding (dynamic, via SubscriptionReference.Address)
   client.notification()              # sub-binding accessor
   ```

2. **Security (Advanced Security)**
   - **Root:** `AdvancedSecurityServiceBinding`
   - **Sub-bindings:**
     - `AuthorizationServerBinding`
     - `KeystoreBinding`
     - `JWTBinding`
     - `Dot1XBinding`
     - `TLSServerBinding`
     - `MediaSigningBinding`

   Usage in library:
   ```python
   client.security()                  # root binding
   client.authorizationserver(xaddr)  # sub-binding accessor (requires xAddr)
   client.keystore(xaddr)             # ..
   client.jwt(xaddr)
   client.dot1x(xaddr)
   client.tlsserver(xaddr)
   client.mediasigning(xaddr)
   ```

3. **Analytics**
   - **Root:** `AnalyticsEngineBinding`
   - **Sub-bindings:**
     - `RuleEngineBinding`

   Usage in library:
   ```python
   client.analytics()   # root binding
   client.ruleengine()  # sub-binding accessor
   ```
</details>

### Summary

- **Single binding services:** Always accessed directly (e.g. `client.media()`).
- **Multi-binding services:** Have a root + sub-binding(s). Root is fixed; sub-bindings may require dynamic creation or explicit xAddr (e.g. `client.pullpoint(subscription)`, `client.authorizationserver(xaddr)`).

## Future Improvements (Stay tuned and star ⭐ this repo)

- [x] Add debugging mode with raw xml on SOAP requests and responses. ([c258162](https://github.com/nirsimetri/onvif-python/commit/c258162))
- [ ] Add functionality for `ONVIFClient` to accept a custom `wsdl_path` service.
- [ ] Add asynchronous (async/await) support for non-blocking ONVIF operations and concurrent device communication.
- [ ] Add `ONVIF CLI` program to interact directly with ONVIF devices via terminal.
- [ ] Implement structured data models for ONVIF Schemas using [xsdata](https://github.com/tefra/xsdata).
- [ ] Integrate [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict) for simplified XML parsing and conversion.
- [ ] Enhance documentation with API references and diagrams (not from [AI Wiki](https://deepwiki.com/nirsimetri/onvif-python)).
- [ ] Add more usage examples for advanced features.
- [ ] Add benchmarking and performance metrics.
- [ ] Add community-contributed device configuration templates.
