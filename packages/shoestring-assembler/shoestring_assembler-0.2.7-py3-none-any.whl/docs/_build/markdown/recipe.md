# Solution Recipe

The assembler builds solutions from a recipe. This document will describe how to write a recipe section by section.

## Solution Header

```toml
recipe_vsn = "1.0.0"

[solution]
    name = "Power Monitoring"
    slug = "power_monitoring"
    version = "1.3.0"
    description = "Shoestring Power Monitoring Starter Solution"
```

| Key           | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `recipe_vsn`  | Recipe format version - currently only 1.0.0 used.                                                                                                  |
| `name`        | Single phrase name of the solution                                                                                                                  |
| `slug`        | Underscore separated slug for the solution                                                                                                          |
| `version`     | Version string - Major . Minor . Patch                                                                                                              |
| `description` | Text describing the solution - not currently used for anything but seems like a good thing to have, even if purely as context when reading a recipe |

## Sources

### Format:

```toml
[source.<source_name>]
    # FILE SOURCE
    file.path = "<file path - usually relative>"
    file.mode = "<copy | link>"

    # or

    # GIT SOURCE 
    git.path = "<see below>"
    git.tag = "<tag value>"
    # or
    git.branch = "<branch name>"
```

* `file` source takes precedence over `git` if both are present.
* `file.mode` is either `"copy"` or `"link"`. If **copy**, the contents at `file.path` are copied, if **link** a symlink is used.
* if `file.mode` not present - defaults to `"copy"`
* `git.path` can take the following forms:
  * `<repo_name>` - DigitalShoestringSolutions org on GitHub assumed (`https://github.com/DigitalShoestringSolutions/` added as a prefix)
  * `<user or org>/<repo_name>` - GitHub is assumed (`https://github.com/` added as a prefix)
  * `<full url>` (including more than two `/`) - no assumptions are made
* if `git.tag` and `git.branch` both present, `git.tag` takes precedence

> `source_name` must be unique within the recipe and must be a valid for use as a directory name (You can check your recipe with the assembler and it will warn you if this is not the case)

### Example:

```toml
[source.current_sensing]
    git.path = "sm_SensingDC"
    git.branch = "rc/1.0.0"
[source.data_storage]
    git.path = "DigitalShoestringSolutions/sm_timeseries_db"
    git.branch = "rc/2.0.0"
[source.grafana]
    git.path = "sm_grafana_ui"
    git.branch = "rc/2.0.0"
[source.analysis]
    git.path = "sm_analysis"
    git.branch = "main"
[source.graph_src]
    file.path = "./custom_service_modules/graph"
    file.mode = "link"
[source.mqtt_broker]
    git.path = "sm_mqtt_broker"
    git.branch = "rc/2.0.0"
```

## Service Modules

### Format:

```toml
[service_module.<service_module_name>]
    source = "<source_name>"
    containers = ["<list of one or more container names>"]
    ports.<container_name>.<port_name> = <host port number>
    ... # more ports entries
    alias.<container_name> = "<alias in docker network>"   # .docker.local suffix added on the end
    ...  # more alias entries (max 1 per container)
    volume.<container_name>.<volume_name> = "<host_path>"
    ... # more volume entries
    template.<variable_name> = "<value>"
    ...  # more template entries
```

#### `<service_module_name>`

`service_module_name` must be unique within the recipe and must be a valid for use as a directory name (just like `source_name` above).

#### `source = "<source_name>"`

`source_name` value must be one of the source names defined as `[source.<source_name>]` in the previous section.

### `containers = ["<list of one or more container names>"]`

The list of container names will typically only have a single entry, but may have more than one in certain scenarios. The container names come from the service module sourceâ€™s meta.toml file. In the example below the two container names are `influx` and `telegraf` which would lead to `containers = ["influx","telegraf"]` if both were used.

```toml
[influx]
    dockerfile = "influx.Dockerfile"
    compose_partial = "influx.snippet.yml"
    volume.data.path = "/var/lib/influxdb2"
    volume.data.mode = "rw"
    volume.user_config.ignore = true
    
    ports.ui = 8086

[telegraf]
    dockerfile = "telegraf.Dockerfile"
    compose_partial = "telegraf.snippet.yml"
    volume.user_config.ignore = true 
    volume.data.ignore = true
```

> Example meta.toml file from timeseries_db

### `ports.<container_name>.<port_name> = <host port number>`

The `ports` entry describes a mapping between a container port and a host port.

`container_name` is as described in the prior section. The `port_name` corresponds to the port name in the `meta.toml` (in the form `ports.<port_name>` - `ports.ui` for a `port_name` of `ui` in the example above).

> The `port_name` in the recipe and in the meta file must match

For example, if the recipe had `ports.app.api = 8001` and the corresponding `meta.toml` had:

```toml
[app]
    ports.api = 80
```

Then this would make port 80 within the container available at port 8001 on the host device (meaning other devices could access the api at port 8001).

### `volume.<container_name>.<volume_name> = "<host_path>"`

The host portion of a volume mapping, similar to a port mapping above.

An example of this is the barcode scanning service module which includes a mapping for `/run/udev` to detect and access barcode scanners

```toml
[service_module.scanner-1]
    ...
    volume.sensing.udev = "/run/udev"
    ...
```

> recipe.toml
```toml
[sensing]
    ...
    volume.udev.path = "/run/udev"
    volume.udev.mode = "ro"
```

> meta.toml

### `template.<variable_name> = "<value>"`

`template` entries are used to define variable names and values that are applied using mustache style template replacement (`{{variable_name}}`) to the provided snippets file.

> The snippets file is combined with the content generated by the assembler to form the compose entry for each container in a service module.

A common application of this is setting the log level:

```toml
[service_module.scanner-1]
    ...
    template.log_level = "info"
    ...

```

> recipe.toml
```yaml
...
command: ["python", "main.py", "--log", "{{log_level}}"]
...
```

> snippet.yaml

## Infrastructure

Same as Service Modules, just with `[infrastructure.<name>]` instead of `[service_module.<name>]` at the top level.
