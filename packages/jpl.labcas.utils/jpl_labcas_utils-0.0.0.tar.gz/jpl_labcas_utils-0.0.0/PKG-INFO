        ### Terms and Conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution
        
        #### 1. Definitions
        
        “License” shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
        distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
        “Licensor” shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
        owner that is granting the License.

        “Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
        is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
        annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
        original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
        shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
        name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
        “Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
        of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
        thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
        by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
        on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,

        “Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
        of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
        incorporated within the Work.
        
        #### 2. Grant of Copyright License
        
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
        grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
        irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
        Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
        #### 3. Grant of Patent License
        
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
        grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
        irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
        made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
        such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
        that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
        of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
        Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
        patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
        for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        #### 4. Redistribution
        
        You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
        in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
        provided that You meet the following conditions:
        
        * **(a)** You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
        this License; and
        * **(b)** You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
        changed the files; and
        * **(c)** You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
        all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
        of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works; and
        * **(d)** If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any
        Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
        attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
        following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
        Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
        with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
        Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
        the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
        provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
        modifying the License.
        
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
        distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
        provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
        with the conditions stated in this License.
        
        #### 5. Submission of Contributions
        
        Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
        for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
        conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
        any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
        such Contributions.
        
        #### 6. Trademarks
        
        This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
        service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
        reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        #### 7. Disclaimer of Warranty
        
        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
        Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
        including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
        solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
        redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
        permissions under this License.
        
        #### 8. Limitation of Liability
        
        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
        contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
        out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
        damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
        any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
        been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        #### 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability
        
        While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
        offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
        in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
        sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
        agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
        accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# LabCAS Utilities

This is a hodge-podge collection of various utilities for managing, reporting on, and maintaining instances of the [Laboratory Catalog and Archive System](https://github.com/jpl-labcas) (LabCAS).


## 📀 Installation

Using Python 3.9 or newer, create a virtual environment and install it:

    python3 -m venv venv
    venv/bin/pip install jpl.labacs.utils


## 🔧 The Utilities

The numerous utilities are quickly summarized below:

- `assign-uuids` — finds Solr documents without a UUID and assign one
- `backup-labcas` — issues backup commands for the Solr cores for LabCAS, "collections", "datasets", and "files"
- `common-prefixes` — allegedly finds common prefixes in FileLocation fields in Solr (but doesn't?)
- `date-report` — writes a CSV to stdout of protocols with dates and dates of corresponding collections in LabCAS
- `dcm-header-usage` — shows usage of DICOM headers in Lung_Team_Project_2 and Prostate_MRI collections based on a Google spreadsheet for input
- `delete-collection` — deletes a collection (including all of its datasets and files) from LabCAS Solr
- `delete-datasets` — deletes datasets from LabCAS Solr while producing a CSV of the corresponding files that will need to be deleted from disk
- `delete-field` — deletes a field from documents in Solr
- `field-usage` — tells what fields are in use by collections, datasets, and files in Solr and marks those that appear in collection and dataset `.cfg` files
- `fix-event-ids` — repairs event IDs in Solr after publication of a dataset (or collection) that uses event IDs based on a [LabCAS publish](https://github.com/jpl-labcas/publish) `alias.json` file
- `fix-patient-ids` — overwrites `PatiendID` field in DICOM files with event IDs from Solr
- `fix-principals` — sets the `OwnerPrincipal` fields of the "collections", "datasets", and "files" cores in Solr based on information in [metadata `.cfg` files](https://github.com/EDRN/EDRN-metadata)
- `mangle-headers` — mangles DICOM headers according to Radka's specifications
- `mass-spec-fix` — fixed misspelled "mass spectrometry" in Solr cores
- `missing-bbd-dcis` — finds missing anonymized BBD and DCIS not specified in a given `.csv` file
- `missing-event-ids` — given event IDs, report which are missing in LabCAS Solr
- `populate-bbd-dcis` — populate the BBD or DCIS files in Solr with filenames in a BBD or DCIS `.csv` file
- `replace-field` — replace a list field in Solr with a new single value
- `replace-fields` — replace a list field in Solr with multiple values
- `report` — generate various reports, including events, privacy, event correlation, availability, or patient IDs
- `report-fields` — generate a report on requested fields
- `report-file-size` — report total size of all files in LabCAS using Solr metadata
- `restructure-bbd-dcis` — make symlinks into the `Validation` and `Discovery` folders for BBD and DCIS data on disk
- `s3-report` — generate a report about files, sub-folders, and average number of files in sub-folders in S3
- `split-brsi` — split the contents of a gzip'd tar file into training and validation folders based on a spreadsheet input
- `sub-field` — substitute the value of a field in multiple documents

Many of these utilities are one-offs, which is typical for LabCAS.


## 🔁 Looping

Some of these utilities loop over large collections of data, paginating through results and making updates. You may have to run the utilities multiple times until they report updating no more documents.


## 🛤️ Solr and Tunneling

Many of these utilities operate on Solr that's assumed to be at `https://localhost:8984/solr/` with a self-signed certificate. You can override these with a `--solr` option.

Feel free to tunnel these connection over `ssh` to a preferential Solr, or run it directly on a host like `edrn-labcas`, `mcl-labcas`, `labcas-dev`, and so forth.


## 🖥️ Development

To install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/jpl-labcas/jpl.labcas.utils.git
    cd jpl.labcas.utils
    pre-commit install
