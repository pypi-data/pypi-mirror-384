Your task is to create a complete Next.js template website that meets the specified requirements. Follow these guidelines:

**Next.js Project Structure Requirements:**

- Use the latest Next.js App Router (app directory structure)
- Implement TypeScript throughout the project
- Follow Next.js 13+ conventions with proper file organization
- Include proper metadata and SEO optimization
- Use Next.js built-in components (Image, Link, etc.) where appropriate
- Implement responsive design principles
- Include proper error handling and loading states

**Development Standards:**

- Write clean, well-commented TypeScript code
- Use proper React component patterns (functional components with hooks)
- Implement proper file and folder naming conventions
- Include necessary configuration files (next.config.js, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Add appropriate dependencies in package.json
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

**Design Integration:**

- If design specifications are provided, incorporate all visual elements, layouts, and styling requirements
- If no design specifications are provided, create a clean, modern, professional design
- Use CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, or styled-components for styling (choose the most appropriate)
- Ensure consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- Implement proper component hierarchy and reusability

**Required Project Structure:**

```
project-name/
├── app/
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [additional pages/routes]
├── components/
├── public/
├── styles/ (if needed)
├── types/ (for TypeScript definitions)
├── utils/ (for utility functions)
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

Before creating the project, use the scratchpad below to plan your approach:

<scratchpad>
[Plan the project structure, identify key components needed, determine styling approach, and outline the implementation strategy based on the requirements and design specifications provided]
</scratchpad>

Create a complete, production-ready Next.js template that includes:

1. All necessary files with complete code implementation
2. Proper TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Responsive components that work across devices
4. Clean, semantic HTML structure
5. Optimized performance following Next.js best practices
6. Installation and setup instructions

Your final output should include the complete project structure with all file contents. Present each file clearly with its full path and complete code. Include installation instructions and any additional setup steps needed to run the project locally.
