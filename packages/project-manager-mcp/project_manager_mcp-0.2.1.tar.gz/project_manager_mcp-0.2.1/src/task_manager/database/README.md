# Database Module - Refactored Structure

This directory contains the refactored database layer, organized into focused modules for better maintainability.

## File Structure

- **__init__.py** (383 lines) - TaskDatabase wrapper class that provides backward-compatible interface
- **connection.py** (574 lines) - Database connection management and schema initialization
- **locks.py** (209 lines) - Atomic task locking for agent coordination
- **sessions.py** (184 lines) - Dashboard session management and event logging
- **projects.py** (615 lines) - Project and epic CRUD operations
- **tasks.py** (120 lines) - Task operations with RA metadata (delegates to legacy)
- **knowledge.py** (89 lines) - Knowledge management operations (delegates to legacy)
- **_legacy.py** (3763 lines) - Original monolithic implementation (preserved for method delegation)

## Architecture

The refactoring uses a composition pattern:

1. **DatabaseConnection** - Manages SQLite connection, WAL mode, and schema
2. **Repository Classes** - Specialized classes for different domain areas:
   - LockRepository
   - SessionRepository
   - ProjectRepository
   - TaskRepository
   - KnowledgeRepository
3. **TaskDatabase** - Facade that delegates to repositories, maintaining full backward compatibility

## Backward Compatibility

All existing code continues to work without changes. The TaskDatabase class exposes the same public API as before, now delegating to specialized repositories.

## Benefits

- **Better Organization**: 3763-line monolith split into focused 100-600 line modules
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to lock logic only affect locks.py
- **Clear Separation**: Connection management separate from business logic
- **Test Coverage**: All 40 database tests + 18 MCP tests + 3 API tests pass
- **No Breaking Changes**: 100% backward compatible

## _legacy.py - Transitional Pattern

**Status**: Transitional (planned for removal within 2-4 weeks)

The tasks.py and knowledge.py modules currently use a **transitional delegation pattern** to maintain backward compatibility while refactoring:

```python
# tasks.py approach
from ._legacy import TaskDatabase as _LegacyDB
self._legacy = type('_LegacyMethods', (), {})()  # Anonymous class for method binding
# Dynamically binds 23+ methods from legacy implementation
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ Maintains 100% backward compatibility during refactoring
- ✅ All tests pass without modification (281/281 tests)
- ✅ Allows incremental migration of methods
- ✅ Reduces risk of introducing bugs

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Dynamic method binding defeats IDE "Go to Definition"
- ⚠️ Type checking less effective on bound methods
- ⚠️ Method signatures not immediately visible
- ⚠️ Creates dependency on 3,763-line legacy file

**Migration Path** (Priority order):
1. ✅ **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Refactor connection, locks, sessions, projects into standalone modules
2. **Phase 2 (TODO)**: Extract task methods from _legacy.py into tasks.py proper implementations
3. **Phase 3 (TODO)**: Extract knowledge methods from _legacy.py into knowledge.py proper implementations
4. **Phase 4 (TODO)**: Delete _legacy.py entirely

**Timeline**: Target completion by [DATE + 4 weeks]

**Alternative considered**: Direct inheritance from legacy class was simpler but created tighter coupling and made it harder to reorganize the class hierarchy.
