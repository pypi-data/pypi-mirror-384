## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Commands-com/pm.git

# Install the plugin
/plugin install project-manager

# Restart Claude Code to activate
```

### ⚠️ Important: MCP Server Setup Required

After installing the plugin, you must also configure the MCP server:

```bash
# Add MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add project-manager-mcp -- uvx project-manager-mcp

# Restart Claude Code
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Manual Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Commands-com/pm.git
cd pm

# Install via pip (for MCP server)
pip install project-manager-mcp

# Or use uvx (no installation needed)
uvx project-manager-mcp
```

## Usage

### Starting a New Project

```bash
# Initialize the workflow
/pm:init

# Create a PRD
/pm:prd-new

# Convert to epic and tasks
/pm:prd-to-epic
/pm:epic-tasks

# View status
/pm:status

# Start working
/pm:next
/pm:task-start
```

### Working with Tasks

```bash
# Get next recommended task
/pm:next

# Start a task (with automatic complexity assessment)
/pm:task-start

# Verify assumptions (RA methodology)
/pm:verify

# Sync progress to GitHub
/pm:task-sync
```

### Advanced Workflows

```bash
# Run entire epic with maximum parallelization
/pm:epic-run

# Assess task complexity standalone
/pm:assess

# Review implementation plan before coding
/pm:plan-review
```

## MCP Server Integration

The plugin automatically configures the MCP server with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "project-manager-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["project-manager-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This provides access to all MCP tools:
- `create_task`, `update_task`, `get_task_details`
- `acquire_task_lock`, `release_task_lock`
- `list_projects`, `list_epics`, `list_tasks`
- `get_knowledge`, `upsert_knowledge`
- `add_ra_tag`, `capture_assumption_validation`
- And more!

## Response Awareness (RA) Methodology

This plugin implements the RA methodology for managing AI assumptions:

- **Complexity Assessment** - Automatic 1-10 scoring
- **RA Tags** - Track assumptions during implementation
- **Verification Agents** - Validate assumptions before completion
- **Knowledge Capture** - Document hard-won insights

Learn more: See `/pm:help` for detailed RA workflow
