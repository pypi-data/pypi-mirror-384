GOES-East and GOES-West satellite data are made available on Amazon Web Services through [NOAA's Open Data Dissemination Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination). **GOES-2-go** is a python package that makes it easy to find and download the files you want from [AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/) to your local computer with some additional helpers to visualize and understand the data.

# Installation

The easiest way to install `goes2go` and its dependencies is with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) from conda-forge.

```
conda install -c conda-forge goes2go
```

You may also create the provided Conda environment, **[`environment.yml`](https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/blob/main/environment.yml)**.

```bash
# Download environment file
wget https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/raw/main/environment.yml

# Modify that file if you wish.

# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate goes2go
```

Alternatively, `goes2go` is published on PyPI and you can install it with pip, _but_ it requires some additional dependencies that you will have to install yourself:

- Python 3.8+
- [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html), which requires GEOS and Proj (if using `cartopy<0.22.0`).
- MetPy
- _Optional:_ [Carpenter Workshop](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Carpenter_Workshop)

When those are installed within your environment, _then_ you can install GOES-2-go with pip.

```bash
# Latest published version
pip install goes2go

# ~~ or ~~

# Most recent changes
pip install git+https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go.git
```

```

## Download Data

Download GOES ABI or GLM NetCDF files to your local computer. Files can also be read with xarray.

First, create a GOES object to specify the satellite, data product, and domain you are interested in. The example below downloads the Multi-Channel Cloud Moisture Imagery for CONUS.

```python
from goes2go import GOES

# ABI Multi-Channel Cloud Moisture Imagry Product
G = GOES(satellite=16, product="ABI-L2-MCMIP", domain='C')

# Geostationary Lightning Mapper
G = GOES(satellite=17, product="GLM-L2-LCFA", domain='C')

# ABI Level 1b Data
G = GOES(satellite=17, product="ABI-L1b-Rad", domain='F')
```

> A complete listing of the products available are available [here](https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/blob/main/src/goes2go/product_table.txt).

There are methods to do the following:

- List the available files for a time range
- Download data to your local drive for a specified time range
- Read the data into an xarray Dataset for a specific time

```python
   # Produce a pandas DataFrame of the available files in a time range
   df = G.df(start='2022-07-04 01:00', end='2022-07-04 01:30')
```

```python
   # Download and read the data as an xarray Dataset nearest a specific time
   ds = G.nearesttime('2022-01-01')
```

```python
   # Download and read the latest data as an xarray Dataset
   ds = G.latest()
```

```python
   # Download data for a specified time range
   G.timerange(start='2022-06-01 00:00', end='2022-06-01 01:00')

   # Download recent data for a specific interval
   G.timerange(recent='30min')
```

## RGB Recipes

The `rgb` xarray accessor computes various RGB products from a GOES ABI **_ABI-L2-MCMIP_** (multi-channel cloud and moisture imagry products) `xarray.Dataset`. See the [demo](https://goes2go.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/notebooks/DEMO_rgb_recipes.html#) for more examples of RGB products.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ds = GOES().latest()
ax = plt.subplot(projection=ds.rgb.crs)
ax.imshow(ds.rgb.TrueColor(), **ds.rgb.imshow_kwargs)
ax.coastlines()
```

## Field of View

The `FOV` xarray accessor creates `shapely.Polygon` objects for the ABI and GLM field of view. See notebooks for [GLM](https://goes2go.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/notebooks/field-of-view_GLM.html) and [ABI](https://goes2go.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/notebooks/field-of-view_ABI.html) field of view.

```python
from goes2go.data import goes_latest
G = goes_latest()
# Get polygons of the full disk or ABI domain field of view.
G.FOV.full_disk
G.FOV.domain
# Get Cartopy coordinate reference system
G.FOV.crs
```

GOES-West is centered over -137 W and GOES-East is centered over -75 W. When GOES was being tested, it was in a "central" position, outlined in the dashed black line. Below is the ABI field of view for the full disk:

The GLM field of view is slightly smaller and limited by a bounding box. Below is the approximated GLM field of view:

### What if I don't like the GOES-2-go or Python?

As an alternative you can use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to download GOES files from AWS. I quite like rclone. Here is a [short rclone tutorial](https://github.com/blaylockbk/pyBKB_v3/blob/master/rclone_howto.md).

I hope you find this makes GOES data easier to retrieve and display. Enjoy!
