  Handles the seeding and setup of a reproducible Python environment for host projects.

  This class supports:
    - Downloading a seed project's requirements lock file at a specific commit or version.
    - Downloading or using a local requirements file for the target (host) project.
    - Building dependency lock files for the host project based on both the seed project and
      the host requirements, ensuring consistent environment setup.
    - Optionally building a PyPI package for the host project.

  The EnvironmentSeeder is designed to streamline the process of creating reliable and

      2. Determines the appropriate seed project and resolves the exact commit or tag to use.

            if the input reference looks like a commit, i.e., a 40-character hexadecimal string, validate it;

            Python version, e.g., 3.12, and commit.

            dependency exclusions (e.g., excludes libtpu for GPU, or CUDA dependencies for TPU).
