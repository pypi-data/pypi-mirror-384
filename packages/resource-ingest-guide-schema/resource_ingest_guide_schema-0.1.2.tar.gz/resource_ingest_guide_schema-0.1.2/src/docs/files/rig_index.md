## About RIGs

Reference Ingest Guides (RIGs) are structured documents that describe the scope, rationale, and modeling approach for ingesting content from an external source to a data repository compliant with the Biolink Model.

Each RIG contains:

- **Source Information**: Details about the data source, including access locations, formats, and terms of use
- **Ingest Information**: What content is included/excluded and why, including relevant files and filtering criteria
- **Target Information**: How the data is modeled in the output graph, including edge and node types
- **Provenance Information**: Contributors and related artifacts

For guidance on creating new RIGs, see the [RIG Creation Guide](example-rigs.md).
