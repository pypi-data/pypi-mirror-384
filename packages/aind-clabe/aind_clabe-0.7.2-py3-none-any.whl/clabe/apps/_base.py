    """
    Abstract base class representing an application that can be run and managed.

    This class defines the interface for applications that can be executed and managed by the launcher.
    Subclasses must implement the abstract methods to define the specific behavior of the application.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        run() -> subprocess.CompletedProcess:
            Executes the application. Must be implemented by subclasses.
        output_from_result(allow_stderr: Optional[bool]) -> Self:
            Processes and returns the output from the application's result.
            Must be implemented by subclasses.
        result() -> subprocess.CompletedProcess:
            Retrieves the result of the application's execution.
            Must be implemented by subclasses.
        add_app_settings(**kwargs) -> Self:
            Adds or updates application settings. Can be overridden by subclasses
            to provide specific behavior for managing application settings.

    Notes:
        Subclasses must implement the abstract methods and property to define the specific
        behavior of the application.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Implement a custom app
        class MyApp(App):
            def run(self) -> subprocess.CompletedProcess: return subprocess.run(["echo", "hello"])

            def result(self) -> subprocess.CompletedProcess: return self._result

        app = MyApp()
        app.run()
        ```
