"""Tests for the quantum circuit generation functions in the YAQS circuit library.

This module contains tests for verifying the correctness of quantum circuits generated
by the functions `create_ising_circuit` and `create_Heisenberg_circuit` from the YAQS circuit library.

The tests ensure:
- Circuits have the correct number of qubits (both even and odd cases).
- Circuits contain the expected quantum gates (e.g., rx, rz, rzz, rxx, ryy).
- Gate counts match expected values based on circuit parameters (J, g, Jx, Jy, Jz, h, dt, timesteps).

These tests help maintain consistency and correctness of circuit generation used
in quantum simulations within the YAQS project.
