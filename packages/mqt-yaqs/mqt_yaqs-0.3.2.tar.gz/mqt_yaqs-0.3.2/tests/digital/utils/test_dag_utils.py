"""Tests for the DAG utility functions.

This module contains unit tests for the DAG utility functions used in the conversion and processing
of quantum circuits. It verifies that the functions correctly extract gate operations from a DAGCircuit,
group nodes into single-qubit and two-qubit (even/odd) categories, ignore unsupported operations (such as
measure and barrier), and compute properties like the longest gate distance and appropriate starting point
ranges for gate application.
