# UI Primitives

This directory contains reusable UI primitives for the frontend. Prefer composing these primitives into higher-level components elsewhere in `src/components`.

Guidelines:

- Reuse existing primitives where possible.
- Create new primitives only when they will be used in multiple places.
- Keep primitives stateless and styleable via props/className.
