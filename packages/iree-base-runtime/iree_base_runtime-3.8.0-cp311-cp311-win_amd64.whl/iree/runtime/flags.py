"""Global runtime flags.

Obligatory disclaimer: there are APIs for managing most of this in a library
friendly way, and those are almost always better. However, flags as are
typically passed to `iree-run-module` can be set *process wide* by using
the `parse_flags` API below.

In addition, the `IREE_PY_RUNTIME_FLAGS` environment variable, if present,
will cause the included flags to be parsed at import time.
"""

from ._binding import parse_flags

# When enabled, performs additional function input validation checks. In the
# event of errors, this will yield nicer error messages but comes with a
# runtime cost.
FUNCTION_INPUT_VALIDATION = True
