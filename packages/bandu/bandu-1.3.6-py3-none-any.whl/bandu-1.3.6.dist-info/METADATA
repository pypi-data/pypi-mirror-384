# BandU
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<h1><p align="center">BandU OVERVIEW</p></h1>

<p align="justify">A package that performs a principal component inspired analysis on the Bloch wavefunctions of 
periodic material to provide a real space visualization of the states that significantly contribute to the Fermi surface.
</p>

<p align="justify">These real space functions can then be projected onto the Fermi surface to provide a clear visual
for where a nesting vector may combine two points in reciprocal space.</p>

<p align="justify">This package is designed to be very straightforward in its use, offering Fermi surface and BandU function 
visualizations in as little as 5 lines of Python script. This package can also be used to just visual the Fermi surface, without 
BandU projections, if provided with the necessary k-point and eigenvalue data.</p>

<h1><p align="center">INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</p></h1>

<h2><p align="center">THROUGH GITHUB</p></h2>

1) Inside that directory type on the command line  
   "git clone https://github.com/pcross0405/BandU.git"

2) Type "cd BandU"

3) Make sure you have python's build tool up to date with  
   "python3 -m pip install --upgrade build"

4) Once up to date type  
   "python3 -m build"

5) This should create a "dist" directory with a .whl file inside

6) On the command line type  
   "pip install dist/*.whl" 

<h2><p align="center">THROUGH PIP</p></h2>
