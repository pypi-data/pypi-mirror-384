# MQT Debugger - A Quantum Circuit Debugging Tool

MQT Debugger is a tool for debugging quantum circuits.
It is part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key Features

- Proposes an interface for the simulation of circuits and diagnosis of errors
- Implementation built upon [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core), the backbone of the MQT
- Povides a Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP) server that can be used to integrate the debugger into IDEs

## Getting Started

`mqt.debugger` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.debugger/).

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.debugger
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from mqt import debugger

state = debugger.create_ddsim_simulation_state()
with open("code.qasm", "r") as f:
    state.load_code(f.read())
f.run_simulation()
print(f.get_state_vector_full())
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/debugger).**

## System Requirements

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.26 or newer.
For details on how to build the project, please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/debugger).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT Debugger is compatible with all [officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
