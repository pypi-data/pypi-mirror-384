"""Define a custom Reasoning and Action agent with intelligent tool matching.

This module implements a sophisticated ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent that uses
large language models for intelligent tool selection and execution. The agent features:

- LLM-based tool matching for query-appropriate tool selection
- Intelligent refusal mechanism when no suitable tools are available
- Dynamic tool filtering based on matched tools
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

The agent workflow follows this pattern:
1. Tool matching: Analyze user query and select appropriate tools
2. Conditional routing: Decide whether to refuse or proceed based on tool availability
3. Model execution: Use selected tools to answer user queries
4. Tool execution: Execute matched tools and return results

Key Features:
- Context-aware tool selection using structured LLM outputs
- Configurable tool-only mode for restricted capability responses
- MCP server integration for external tool providers
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
