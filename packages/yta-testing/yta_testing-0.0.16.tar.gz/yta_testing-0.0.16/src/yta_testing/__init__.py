    Call this method providing some code defined
    as a function to validate that it is raising
    an exception when called (send the function,
    not the call).

    The 'exception_type' can be an Exception, a
    TypeError, a ValueError, a string including
    the name of the exception type to expect, or
    None if the type is not important and must 
    not be checked.

    The 'message' can be the string we expect to
    be received as the exception message, or None
    if we don't care about the message. We will
    look for the provided 'message' text inside
    the exception message, it can be a part of 
    the message and not the exact one.

    Here is an example:
    ```
    assert_exception_is_raised(
        function = lambda: ParameterValidator.validate_tuple('tuple', 3),
        exception_type = None,
        message = 'The provided "tuple" parameter is not a tuple.'
