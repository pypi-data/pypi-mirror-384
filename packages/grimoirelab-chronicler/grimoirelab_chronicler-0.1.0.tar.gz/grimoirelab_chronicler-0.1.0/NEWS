# Releases

## grimoirelab-chronicler 0.1.0 - (2025-10-16)

**New features:**

 * Identity events for Git commits\
   This update introduces functionality to extract and eventize
   identities from git commit data. It handles authors, committers, and
   signers, creating events for each identity found.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Event ID generation for Git actions updated\
   Commits containing multiple copy file actions for the same file
   generated duplicate event IDs because the new file name wasnâ€™t
   included in the ID calculation.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Python minimum version updated\
   Python 3.8 will reached its end of life in October 2024. Most recent
   Linux distributions provide Python 3.11 or 3.12 as the default
   version. Versions 3.8 and 3.9 are reaching their end of life soon, so
   we think it's better to drop these old versions and start fresh.
