MCP Service Orchestrator - Refactored Version

🏗️ Modular refactoring completed!

The original 2056-line orchestrator.py has been refactored into 8 specialized modules:
- base_orchestrator.py: Core infrastructure and lifecycle management (12 methods)
- monitoring_tasks.py: Monitoring tasks and loop management (12 methods)
- service_connection.py: Service connection and state management (15 methods)
- tool_execution.py: Tool execution and processing (4 methods)
- service_management.py: Service management and information retrieval (15 methods)
- resources_prompts.py: Resources/Prompts functionality (12 methods)
- network_utils.py: Network utilities and error handling (2 methods)
- standalone_config.py: Standalone configuration adapter (6 methods)

 Total of 78 methods, fully maintains backward compatibility
 Uses Mixin design pattern, clear separation of functional modules
 Each module focuses on specific functional areas, code organization is clearer
 Supports parallel development, more precise problem location, easier unit testing

This file is now a simple import proxy, actual implementation is in the orchestrator/ package.
