def htmc_color_pc_cells(text: str) -> str:
    """This function finds cells in a html table that contain numerical values
    (and a few known strings) followed by a single space and an identifier.
    Depending on the identifier, it shades the cell in a specific way. A set of
    12 color palettes for setting those shades are encoded in ./style.css.
    These are 'cna' (grey), 'c0' (red), 'c1' ... 'c10' (green). The shade 'cna'
    is used for items that are marked as 'not applicable'. The shades 'c1' to
    'c9' form a gradient from red to lime-green to indicate 'levels of
    completeness'. 'cna' is used for greying out a box for 'not applicable'
    items, 'c0' is for items that are considered risky (or not yet started) and
    'c10' for items that have completed successfully, or that are
    'in good standing'.

    These are the supported identifiers: %, %u, G, B, E, W, EN, WN.
    The shading behavior for these is described below.

    %:  Coloured percentage, where the number in front of the '%' sign is
        mapped to a color for the cell ranging from red ('c0') to
        green ('c10').
    %u: Uncoloured percentage, where no markup is applied and '%u' is replaced
        with '%' in the output.
    G:  This stands for 'Good' and results in a green cell.
    B:  This stands for 'Bad' and results in a red cell.
    E:  This stands for 'Errors' and the cell is colored with red if the number
        in front of the indicator is larger than 0. Otherwise the cell is
        colored with green.
    W:  This stands for 'Warnings' and the cell is colored with yellow ('c6')
        if the number in front of the indicator is larger than 0. Otherwise
        the cell is colored with green.
    EN: This stands for 'Errors Negative', which behaves the same as 'E' except
        that the cell is colored red if the number in front of the indicator is
        negative.
    WN: This stands for 'Warnings Negative', which behaves the same as 'W'
        except that the cell is colored yellow if the number in front of the
        indicator is negative.

    N/A items can have any of the following indicators and need not be
    proceeded with a numerical value:

    '--', 'NA', 'N.A.', 'N.A', 'N/A', 'na', 'n.a.', 'n.a', 'n/a'
