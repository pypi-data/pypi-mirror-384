# scSurv
## Description
[scSurv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.10.627659v1) is a novel method for single-cell survival analysis.
This model offers three main analyses:
1. Quantification of individual cells' contributions to clinical outcomes
2. Identification of prognosis-associated gene sets
3. Mapping of spatial hazard distributions using spatial transcriptome data

Through these applications, scSurv provides a comprehensive and interpretable framework that reveals heterogeneity in the clinical significance of cells. 
This framework enables the identification of novel cell populations and genes involved in the prognosis.

## The scSurv framework
1. The VAE compresses raw gene expression into low-dimensional latent cell representations
2. Deconvolution of bulk data
3. Estimation of regression coefficients in hazard functions for each cell using the extended Cox proportional hazards model

# Installation
You can install scSurv using pip command.
```
!pip install scsurv
```
You can use the latest development version from GitHub.
```
!git clone https://github.com/3254c/scSurv.git
```

# Dependencies
Python >= 3.8.16

torch >= 1.13.1

lifelines >= 0.27.8

scanpy >= 1.9.5

pandas >= 1.5.3

numpy >= 1.23.5

matplotlib >= 3.7.2

scipy >= 1.10.1

# Minimal example
## Preparing scRNA-seq data and bulk RNA-seq data
You need to prepare reference scRNA-seq data and bulk RNA-seq data linked to clinical outcome. For instance, TCGA bulk RNA-seq data is available from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). For examples of reference scRNA-seq data, please refer to our paper. 

## Run scSurv
In the tutorial, we demonstrate the usage of scSurv using simulated data.
The bulk_adata.obs must contain the survival outcome data and the event indicators (censoring status).
The scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data must be raw counts.
Please specify the batch_key parameter to indicate the sample origin annotation for each cell.
```
batch_key = 'orig.ident'
exp_name = 'tutolial_simulation.pt'
epoch = 10000

sc_adata, bulk_adata, model_params_dict, spatial_adata, scsurv_exp = workflow.run_scSurv(sc_adata, bulk_adata, exp_name, epoch, batch_key)
```
