"""Deephaven Core+ Session Manager Wrapper for asynchronous interaction with Deephaven Core+.

This module provides an asynchronous wrapper around the Deephaven Core+ SessionManager
(deephaven_enterprise.client.session_manager.SessionManager) that enhances functionality
while maintaining strict interface compatibility. The wrapper adds comprehensive
documentation, robust logging, and ensures non-blocking operation by running potentially
blocking operations in separate threads.

The CorePlusSessionFactory delegates all method calls to the underlying session manager
instance and wraps returned sessions in CorePlusSession objects for consistent behavior.
It provides methods for:
  - Authentication (password, private_key, saml)
  - Worker management (connect_to_new_worker, connect_to_persistent_query)
  - Connection verification (ping)
  - Key management (upload_key, delete_key)

Use this class when you need to interact with Deephaven Core+ servers in an asynchronous
context, such as within asyncio-based applications or when non-blocking operations are
required. The class is thread-safe for concurrent access across different methods, but
care should be taken when accessing the same method concurrently.

Example:
    import asyncio
    from deephaven_mcp.client import CorePlusSessionFactory

    # Create a Core+ session factory connected to a server
    async def main():
        # Create a session factory using the from_url classmethod
        manager = CorePlusSessionFactory.from_url("https://myserver.example.com/iris/connection.json")

        # Authenticate
        await manager.password("username", "password")

        # Connect to a new worker
        session = await manager.connect_to_new_worker()

        # Use the session
        table = session.empty_table()

        # Close the manager when done
        await manager.close()

    asyncio.run(main())

You can also directly instantiate the class with an existing SessionManager:

    from deephaven_enterprise.client.session_manager import SessionManager
    from deephaven_mcp.client import CorePlusSessionFactory

    # Create and wrap an existing session manager
    session_manager = SessionManager("https://myserver.example.com/iris/connection.json")
    wrapped_manager = CorePlusSessionFactory(session_manager)

Note:
    All methods returning a connection or session are asynchronous and return awaitable
    coroutines. Remember to await these methods when using them.

    """Asynchronous wrapper for the Deephaven Core+ SessionManager providing non-blocking operations.

    This class wraps an existing Deephaven Core+ session manager instance, delegating all
    method calls to the underlying instance while providing enhanced documentation, robust error
    handling, and comprehensive logging. The wrapper runs potentially blocking operations in
    separate threads using asyncio.to_thread to ensure non-blocking behavior in asynchronous
    contexts.

    CorePlusSessionFactory serves as a primary entry point for interacting with Deephaven Core+
    servers in asynchronous applications. It manages the lifecycle of server connections and
    provides methods for authentication, worker creation, and session establishment.

    Key features:
    - Full asyncio compatibility with all operations returning awaitable coroutines
    - Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types for different error scenarios
    - Detailed logging of all operations for debugging and monitoring
    - Automatic wrapping of returned sessions in CorePlusSession objects for consistent behavior

    The wrapper preserves the same interface as the original SessionManager class
    but with async methods, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement in asynchronous code.
    All returned sessions are wrapped in CorePlusSession objects for consistent behavior.

    Typical usage flow:

    1. Create a session manager using the from_url classmethod
    2. Authenticate using one of the authentication methods (password, private_key, or saml)
    3. Connect to an existing worker or create a new one
    4. Work with tables and data through the session
    5. Close the session manager when done

    Key operations provided by this class include:
    - Authentication and token management
    - Creating and connecting to persistent queries (workers)
    - Managing public/private key pairs
    - Interacting with the controller to manage server resources

    All methods that might block are implemented as async methods that use asyncio.to_thread
    to prevent blocking the event loop, making this class safe to use in async applications.

        """Initialize the CorePlusSessionFactory wrapper with an existing SessionManager.

        This constructor creates a new CorePlusSessionFactory that wraps an existing SessionManager
        object, providing an asynchronous interface to its methods while preserving all functionality.
        This class serves as the primary entry point for interacting with Deephaven Enterprise servers,
        handling authentication, worker management, and session establishment.

        The constructor automatically initializes both the controller_client and auth_client properties
        by accessing the corresponding properties from the wrapped session manager.

        The CorePlusSessionFactory is designed to provide a convenient async/await interface around
        the synchronous Enterprise SessionManager, running operations in separate threads to avoid
        blocking the event loop. This makes it ideal for integration into async applications, web
        servers, or any environment where non-blocking operations are important.

        Args:
            session_manager: The SessionManager instance to wrap. Must be an instance
                           of deephaven_enterprise.client.session_manager.SessionManager.
                           This should be a properly initialized session manager with valid
                           connection information, though it does not need to be authenticated
                           yet (authentication can be performed through this wrapper's methods).

        Raises:
            TypeError: If the provided session_manager is not an instance of the expected
                       SessionManager class from deephaven_enterprise.client.session_manager.
            ValueError: If the session_manager is not properly initialized or is missing
                       required configuration.
            SessionError: If there was an error initializing the controller_client property.
            AuthenticationError: If there was an error initializing the auth_client property.

        Note:
            In most cases, you should use the class factory methods instead of this constructor:
            - Use from_url() when you have a connection URL to the Deephaven server
            - Use from_config() when you have a configuration dictionary
            - Use from_json() when you have a JSON configuration file

            These factory methods handle initialization details, dependency management, and
            error handling for you in a more convenient way than direct instantiation.

        Example:
            ```python
            # Direct instantiation (not typically recommended)

        This is the recommended and most convenient way to create a CorePlusSessionFactory when you
        have a URL to a Deephaven server. The method handles all the necessary setup:

        1. Validates and parses the provided URL
        2. Establishes initial connection information to the Deephaven server
        3. Creates and configures the underlying SessionManager
        4. Wraps the SessionManager in a CorePlusSessionFactory for asynchronous access

        The method automatically loads the required enterprise dependencies and handles
        initialization details and error conditions, making it much simpler than manually
        creating the session manager.

        Args:
            url: The connection URL for the Deephaven server. This should point to a
                connection.json file that describes how to connect to the server,
                typically in the format "https://<server>/iris/connection.json".
                Both HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported, though HTTPS is strongly
                recommended for production environments. The connection.json file contains
                server endpoints and configuration details necessary for establishing
                connections to various services.

        Returns:
            CorePlusSessionFactory: A new, initialized factory instance connected to the specified
                server. Note that the returned factory is not yet authenticated; you must call one
                of the authentication methods (password(), private_key(), or saml()) before using
                other methods like connect_to_new_worker().

        Raises:
            ModuleNotFoundError: If the required enterprise dependencies are not installed.
            ValueError: If the URL is malformed or cannot be parsed.
            ConnectionError: If the connection.json file cannot be accessed or downloaded.
            JsonDecodeError: If the connection.json file contains invalid JSON.
            ConfigurationError: If the connection configuration is invalid or incomplete.

        Example:
            ```python
            import asyncio
            from deephaven_mcp.client import CorePlusSessionFactory

        Note:
            If you need to connect through a proxy, configure your system's proxy settings

        Create and authenticate a CorePlusSessionFactory from a configuration dictionary.

        This factory method provides a complete solution for creating and initializing a
        CorePlusSessionFactory from a configuration dictionary. It handles the entire process:

        1. Validates the configuration format and required fields
        2. Creates a connection to the specified Deephaven server
        3. Automatically authenticates using the provided credentials
        4. Returns a fully ready-to-use factory instance

        This is the recommended approach when working with configuration files, environment-based
        setups, or any scenario where connection details and authentication information are stored
        in a structured format rather than hardcoded in the application.

        Configuration Format:
        The configuration dictionary must follow the standard enterprise system format with these
        required fields:

        - 'connection_json_url': URL to the Deephaven server's connection.json file
        - 'auth_type': Authentication method to use ('password', 'private_key', or 'saml')

        Additional fields based on auth_type:

        - For 'password' authentication:
            * 'username': The username for authentication
            * Either 'password': The actual password (not recommended for production)
              or 'password_env_var': Name of environment variable containing the password
            * Optional 'effective_user': User to operate as after authentication

        - For 'private_key' authentication:
            * 'private_key_path': The path to the private key file

        - For 'saml' authentication:
            * No additional fields required, but SAML must be configured on server

        Args:
            worker_cfg: Configuration dictionary for the enterprise system connection.
                Must contain the required fields as described above.

        Returns:
            CorePlusSessionFactory: A fully initialized and authenticated factory instance
                ready for immediate use. You can directly call methods like connect_to_new_worker()
                without needing to perform separate authentication steps.

        Raises:
            InternalError: If Core+ features are not available due to missing enterprise
                dependencies (deephaven-enterprise-client package not installed).
            DeephavenConnectionError: If unable to connect to the specified server URL,
                such as network issues or invalid connection.json format.
            AuthenticationError: If authentication fails due to missing or invalid credentials,
                incorrect format, or server-side authentication issues.
            EnterpriseSystemConfigurationError: If the configuration dictionary is invalid,
                missing required fields, or contains incompatible settings.
            EnvironmentError: If a password environment variable is specified but not found
                in the environment.

        Example - Password authentication with environment variable:
            ```python
            import asyncio
            import os
            from deephaven_mcp.client import CorePlusSessionFactory

            # Set password in environment (in practice, this would be set externally)
            os.environ["DH_PASSWORD"] = "my_secure_password"

            async def create_from_config():
                # Define configuration with environment variable for password

                    "password_env_var": "DH_PASSWORD"

                # Create and authenticate in one step
                factory = await CorePlusSessionFactory.from_config(config)

                # Use the factory directly - no authentication needed
                session = await factory.connect_to_new_worker()
                return session
            ```

        Example - Private key authentication:
            ```python
            async def create_with_key():
                # Define configuration with private key path
                config = {
                    "connection_json_url": "https://example.deephaven.io/iris/connection.json",
                    "auth_type": "private_key",
                    "private_key_path": "/path/to/private_key.pem"

                factory = await CorePlusSessionFactory.from_config(config)
                return factory
            ```

        Note:
            This method performs authentication as part of initialization. If authentication
            fails, an exception will be raised and no factory will be returned. For security
            best practices, avoid storing credentials directly in the configuration and instead
            use environment variables or secure credential storage systems.

        Args:
            # Worker identification
            name: Optional name for the worker process. If None (default), an auto-generated name based
                on the current timestamp will be used. A descriptive name can make it easier to
                identify your worker in monitoring tools and logs.

            # Resource configuration
            heap_size_gb: JVM heap size in gigabytes. Determines the maximum amount of memory available
                to the worker process. Larger values are necessary for processing larger datasets, but
                require more system resources. If None (default), the server's default heap size is used.
            server: Specific server to run the worker on. If None (default), the server will be chosen
                automatically from available resources. Useful for targeting specific hardware configurations.
            extra_jvm_args: Additional JVM arguments to configure the worker's Java Virtual Machine.
                Examples include garbage collection settings ("-XX:+UseG1GC"), memory settings, or
                custom Java properties. If None (default), only standard JVM arguments are used.
            extra_environment_vars: Environment variables to set for the worker process.
                Format as ["NAME=value", ...]. Useful for configuring system properties, paths,
                or feature flags. If None (default), the standard environment is used.
            engine: Engine type that determines the worker's capabilities and behavior.
                Defaults to "DeephavenCommunity". Other options may include enterprise engines
                with additional features depending on your Deephaven installation.

            # Lifecycle management
            auto_delete_timeout: Number of seconds of inactivity before the worker is automatically
                terminated and cleaned up. Defaults to 600 (10 minutes). Set to None to prevent
                auto-deletion (not recommended for production use as it can lead to resource leaks).
                Set to 0 for immediate cleanup when the session disconnects.
            timeout_seconds: Maximum time in seconds to wait for the worker to start before raising
                an exception. Defaults to 60 seconds. Increase for slower environments or when
                creating workers with complex initialization processes.

            # Access controls
            admin_groups: List of user groups that have administrative permissions for this worker.
                Admins can modify, restart, or terminate the worker. If None (default), only the
                creator has admin privileges.
            viewer_groups: List of user groups that have read-only access to this worker.
                Viewers can connect to the worker and view its data but cannot modify it.
                If None (default), only the creator has viewing privileges.

            # Advanced configuration
            configuration_transformer: Optional function that takes and returns a configuration dictionary.
                This allows for advanced customization of the worker configuration beyond what the
                standard parameters provide. The function signature should be:
                `(config: dict) -> dict`. Use with caution as it may override other settings.
            session_arguments: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the pydeephaven.Session constructor.
                These parameters control session behavior rather than worker configuration.
                Common options include `disable_open_table_listener` or `chunk_size`.

        Returns:
            CorePlusSession: A fully initialized session object connected to the new worker. This session
                provides methods for creating and manipulating tables, executing queries, and
                performing other Deephaven operations. Always close this session when finished
                to properly release resources.

        Raises:
            ResourceError: If there are insufficient server resources (memory, CPU, etc.) to create
                the worker, or if resource allocation limits have been reached.
            SessionCreationError: If an error occurs during worker creation or connection establishment,
                such as invalid configuration parameters or initialization failures.
            DeephavenConnectionError: If there is a network or communication problem with the Deephaven
                server during worker creation or connection.
            AuthenticationError: If the current authentication is invalid or has insufficient permissions.
            TimeoutError: If worker creation exceeds the specified timeout_seconds.

        Note:
            - Creating a new worker is resource-intensive. For better resource utilization, consider
              using `connect_to_persistent_query` to connect to an existing worker if one is available.
            - Multiple sessions can connect to the same worker by sharing its name/ID.
            - Worker resources are not released until all connected sessions are closed AND the
              auto_delete_timeout period has elapsed (if configured).
            - Always close sessions when finished to prevent resource leaks.
            - The worker will continue to run in the background until explicitly closed or
              terminated by the auto_delete_timeout mechanism.

        method, running it in a separate thread to avoid blocking the event loop. The returned session
        is wrapped in a CorePlusSession for consistent behavior with other MCP client interfaces.

        Args:
            name: The name of the persistent query (worker) to connect to. This is the human-readable
                identifier specified when the worker was created. Either name or serial must be provided,
                but not both. Names are typically easier to use in interactive scenarios and when the
                worker was created with a custom name.
            serial: The unique serial number of the persistent query to connect to. Serial numbers are
                system-assigned unique identifiers that remain constant throughout a worker's lifetime.
                Either name or serial must be provided, but not both. Using serial is more reliable when
                names might be reused or when precise worker identification is critical.
            session_arguments: A dictionary of additional arguments to pass to the underlying
                pydeephaven.Session constructor. This allows customization of session behavior
                such as setting chunk_size for data transfer or configuring query processing options.
                Common options include `disable_open_table_listener` or `chunk_size`.

        Returns:
            CorePlusSession: A fully initialized session object connected to the existing worker.
                This session provides methods for creating and manipulating tables, executing
                queries, and performing other Deephaven operations. The session shares the same
                computation environment with any other sessions connected to the same worker,
                including access to the same tables and variables.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If neither name nor serial is provided (exactly one is required), or if both
                are provided simultaneously (only one identifier should be used).
            QueryError: If the persistent query cannot be found (doesn't exist, was terminated), is not
                in a valid state to accept connections, or cannot be accessed due to permission issues.
            DeephavenConnectionError: If a network-related issue occurs while connecting to the worker,
                such as connectivity problems or server unavailability.
            SessionCreationError: If there's an error establishing the session connection for any other
                reason, such as version incompatibility or resource constraints.
            AuthenticationError: If the current authentication is invalid or has insufficient permissions
                to connect to the specified worker.

        Example - Connecting by name:
            ```python
            import asyncio
            from deephaven_mcp.client import CorePlusSessionFactory

            async def connect_to_existing_worker():
                # Create and authenticate the session manager
                factory = CorePlusSessionFactory.from_url("https://myserver.example.com/iris/connection.json")
                await factory.password("username", "password")

                # Connect to an existing worker by name
                session = await factory.connect_to_persistent_query(name="analytics_worker_v2")

                # Access existing tables from the worker
                my_table = session.get_table("my_table")

                # Close when done
                await factory.close()

                return my_table
            ```

        Example - Connecting by serial number:
            ```python
            async def connect_with_serial():
                factory = CorePlusSessionFactory.from_url("https://myserver.example.com/iris/connection.json")
                await factory.password("username", "password")

                # Get the serial number from somewhere (e.g., stored from previous session)
                serial_number = CorePlusQuerySerial.from_string("0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef")

                # Connect to the worker using its serial number
                session = await factory.connect_to_persistent_query(serial=serial_number)

                return session
            ```

        Note:
            - Multiple clients can connect to the same worker simultaneously
            - All connected sessions share the same execution environment and tables
            - Changes made by one session are visible to all other connected sessions
            - Worker resources are only released when all sessions are closed AND the
              auto_delete_timeout has elapsed (if configured)
            - This method is more efficient than creating a new worker with connect_to_new_worker

        This method is used for managing SSH key-based authentication in Deephaven Enterprise.
        It removes a public key that was previously registered to your account, preventing future
        authentication attempts using the corresponding private key. This is useful for revoking
        access when a key might be compromised or is no longer needed.

        Key management best practices include:
        - Regularly rotating authentication keys for security
        - Removing keys that are no longer in use

        This method performs authentication with the Deephaven server using standard username
        and password credentials. It establishes a secure session that can be used for subsequent
        operations like connecting to workers or managing server resources. This is the most
        common authentication method and is suitable for most use cases.

        The authentication process creates and stores session tokens internally, which are

            password: The user's password for authentication. Authentication is secure and
                passwords are never stored in memory longer than necessary.
            effective_user: The user to operate as after authentication. Defaults to None, which

        Note:
            Private key authentication is an alternative to username/password or SAML authentication.
            Only one authentication method should be used per session.

            Before using this method, you need to:
            1. Generate a key pair using Deephaven's tools
            2. Register the public key with the Deephaven server
            3. Keep the private key secure

            The private key should be stored securely and protected from unauthorized access,
            as anyone with access to the private key can authenticate as the associated user.

        Example with file path:
            ```python

    async def saml(self) -> None:
        """Authenticate asynchronously using SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO).

        This method initiates SAML-based single sign-on authentication with the Deephaven server,
        which is ideal for enterprise environments that have centralized identity management.
        SAML authentication allows users to authenticate using their organization's existing
        identity provider (IdP) such as Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, or other SAML 2.0 compliant services.

        The method asynchronously delegates to the underlying session manager's saml method,
        running it in a separate thread to avoid blocking the event loop. The implementation
        handles all SAML protocol details internally based on server configuration.

        Authentication Process Flow:
        1. This method initiates a SAML authentication request
        2. The user will be redirected to their organization's identity provider login page
        3. After successful authentication with the IdP, the user is redirected back to Deephaven
        4. Authentication tokens are established and stored for subsequent API calls

        Raises:
            AuthenticationError: If SAML authentication fails due to configuration issues, incorrect
                               IdP setup, invalid credentials, account issues, or insufficient permissions.
            DeephavenConnectionError: If there is a problem connecting to the authentication server,
                                    SAML provider, or if network issues prevent authentication.
            SessionError: If the session cannot be established after successful authentication.

        Note:
            SAML authentication provides several benefits:
            - Users can authenticate with their existing organizational credentials
            - No need to manage separate passwords for Deephaven
            - Support for advanced security features like multi-factor authentication
            - Centralized user management and access control

            Prerequisites for using SAML authentication:
            - The Deephaven server must be configured with SAML support
            - The organization's IdP must be properly configured to work with Deephaven
            - Network access must be available to both the Deephaven server and the IdP

            This method must be called before making requests that require authentication,
            unless another authentication method is used instead. Only one authentication
            method should be used per session.

            For detailed information about configuring SAML with Deephaven, refer to the
            Deephaven Enterprise documentation at https://docs.deephaven.io.

        Example:
            ```python
            from deephaven_mcp.client import CorePlusSessionFactory

                await manager.saml()

                # Now we can use the authenticated session manager
                session = await manager.connect_to_new_worker()

                # Use the session to work with tables
                table = session.empty_table()

    async def upload_key(self, public_key_text: str) -> None:
        """Upload a public key to the Deephaven server for certificate-based authentication.

        This method registers a public key with the Deephaven server, associating it with your
        user account. Once uploaded, you can use the corresponding private key to authenticate
        in future sessions without needing a username and password. This is particularly useful
        for automated systems, scripts, and CI/CD pipelines.

        The public key should be in the format generated by Deephaven's key generation tools.
        Typically, this is an RSA public key in PEM format.

        Key-based authentication workflow:
        1. Generate a key pair (typically using Deephaven's tools)
        2. Authenticate to the server using password or SAML
        3. Upload the public key with this method
        4. For future sessions, use private_key() method with the corresponding private key

        This method asynchronously delegates to the underlying session manager's upload_key method,
        running it in a separate thread to avoid blocking the event loop.

        Args:
            public_key_text: The full text representation of the public key to upload. This should be
                the complete PEM-encoded public key, including the header and footer lines
                (e.g., "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----").

        Raises:
            ResourceError: If uploading the key fails due to issues such as invalid key format,
                malformed PEM data, server-side key storage problems, or permission issues.
            DeephavenConnectionError: If there is a problem connecting to the authentication server
                such as network issues or server unavailability.
            AuthenticationError: If the current session is not authenticated or lacks the necessary
                permissions to upload keys.

        Note:
            - You must be authenticated before calling this method
            - Each user can have multiple public keys registered
            - Keys are identified by a fingerprint calculated from the key data
            - If a key with the same fingerprint already exists, it will be overwritten
            - There is no automatic expiration for uploaded keys; they remain valid until removed
