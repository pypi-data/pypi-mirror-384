"""Asynchronous wrapper for the Deephaven ControllerClient.

This module provides an asynchronous wrapper around the Deephaven ControllerClient, enabling non-blocking
operations with the Persistent Query Controller in the Deephaven MCP environment. It manages persistent queries
and their state changes while maintaining the same interface as the original ControllerClient.

The Persistent Query Controller is a core component of Deephaven Enterprise responsible for:
- Creating and managing long-running query processes (workers)
- Monitoring query lifecycle and state changes
- Resource allocation and management for queries
- Query replication and fault tolerance

Key features of this asynchronous wrapper:
1. Full compatibility with modern async/await programming paradigms
2. Non-blocking operations that won't stall the Python event loop
3. Enhanced error handling with specific exception types for better diagnostics
4. Consistent logging for operations and error conditions

All blocking operations are performed using asyncio.to_thread, allowing client code to use async/await syntax
without blocking the event loop. The wrapper also enhances error handling by wrapping exceptions in more specific
and informative custom exception types (e.g., QueryError, DeephavenConnectionError).

Typical usage flow:
1. Create query configurations and add queries
2. Start queries and wait for them to reach the running state
3. Monitor query status and handle state changes
4. Stop, restart, or delete queries as needed

Classes:
    CorePlusControllerClient: Async wrapper around deephaven_enterprise.client.controller.ControllerClient

    - ._protobuf: Contains wrapper classes for query state, configuration, and other protobuf objects
    - ._auth_client: Provides authentication functionality used by the controller client

    """Asynchronous wrapper around the ControllerClient for managing persistent queries.

    This class provides an asynchronous interface to the ControllerClient, which connects to the
    Deephaven PersistentQueryController process. It enables management of persistent queries,
    including creation, modification, and deletion of those queries.

    The controller client facilitates the entire lifecycle of persistent queries, including:
    - Managing query state changes
    - Creating query configurations with appropriate resource allocations
    - Adding new queries to the controller
    - Starting, stopping, restarting, and deleting queries
    - Monitoring query state and health
    - Managing query metadata and configuration

    All blocking calls are performed in separate threads using asyncio.to_thread to avoid blocking
    the event loop. The wrapper maintains the same interface as the underlying ControllerClient
    while making it compatible with asynchronous code.

    Error handling is enhanced with specific exception types that provide more context and clarity
    than the underlying Java exceptions. Network issues typically result in DeephavenConnectionError
    and query-related issues in QueryError.

    Attributes:
        wrapped: The underlying Java ControllerClient instance being wrapped

    Example:
        # Create a controller client from an authenticated session factory
        session_factory = await CorePlusSessionFactory.from_url("https://deephaven-server:10000")
        controller_client = await session_factory.create_controller_client()

        # Create a temporary query configuration and add it
        config = await controller_client.make_temporary_config("my-worker", heap_size_gb=2.0)
        serial = await controller_client.add_query(config)

        # Start the query and wait for it to initialize
        await controller_client.start_and_wait(serial)

        # Monitor the query state
        query_info = await controller_client.get(serial)
        print(f"Query state: {query_info.state}")

        # Clean up when done
        await controller_client.stop_query(serial)
        await controller_client.delete_query(serial)

        # Wait for the query to start running
        await controller_client.start_and_wait(serial)

        # When finished, clean up
        await controller_client.delete_query(serial)

    Notes:
        - All methods are asynchronous and use asyncio.to_thread to run blocking operations in a background thread.
        - Exceptions are wrapped in custom types for clarity (e.g., QueryError, DeephavenConnectionError).
        - Logging is performed for entry, success, and error events at appropriate levels.
