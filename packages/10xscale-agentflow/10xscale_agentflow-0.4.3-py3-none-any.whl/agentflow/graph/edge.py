"""Graph edge representation and routing logic for TAF workflows.

This module defines the Edge class, which represents connections between nodes
in a TAF graph workflow. Edges can be either static (always followed) or
conditional (followed only when certain conditions are met), enabling complex
routing logic and decision-making within graph execution.

Edges are fundamental building blocks that define the flow of execution through
a graph, determining which node should execute next based on the current state
and any conditional logic.

class Edge:
    """Represents a connection between two nodes in a graph workflow.

    An Edge defines the relationship and routing logic between nodes, specifying
    how execution should flow from one node to another. Edges can be either
    static (unconditional) or conditional based on runtime state evaluation.

    Edges support complex routing scenarios including:
    - Simple static connections between nodes
    - Conditional routing based on state evaluation
    - Dynamic routing with multiple possible destinations
    - Decision trees and branching logic

    Attributes:
        from_node: Name of the source node where execution originates.
        to_node: Name of the destination node where execution continues.
        condition: Optional callable that determines if this edge should be
            followed. If None, the edge is always followed (static edge).
        condition_result: Optional value to match against condition result
            for mapped conditional edges.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Static edge - always followed
        static_edge = Edge("start", "process")


        # Conditional edge - followed only if condition returns True
        def needs_approval(state):
            return state.data.get("requires_approval", False)


        conditional_edge = Edge("process", "approval", condition=needs_approval)


        # Mapped conditional edge - follows based on specific condition result
        def get_priority(state):
            return state.data.get("priority", "normal")


        high_priority_edge = Edge("triage", "urgent", condition=get_priority)
        high_priority_edge.condition_result = "high"
        ```
