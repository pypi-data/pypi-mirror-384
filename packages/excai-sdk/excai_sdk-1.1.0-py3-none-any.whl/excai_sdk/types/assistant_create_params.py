    Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the
    message the model generates is valid JSON.

    **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
    produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
    generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
    limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
    the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
    indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
    max context length.
