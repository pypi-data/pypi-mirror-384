    Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on
    audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.

    Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjunction
    with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then
    dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio
    trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and
    wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more
    natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.
