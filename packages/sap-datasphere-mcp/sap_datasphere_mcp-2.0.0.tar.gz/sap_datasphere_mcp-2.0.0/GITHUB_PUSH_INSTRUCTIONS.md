# GitHub Push Instructions

## Issue: Secret Detection

GitHub detected a PyPI API token in the commit history and blocked the push for security.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Allow the Secret (Temporary)
1. Go to this URL: https://github.com/MarioDeFelipe/sap-datasphere-mcp/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/3476v9CmlpLhZOgRjryNy1vHPeO
2. Click "Allow secret" 
3. Then run: `git push -u origin main`

### Option 2: Clean Repository (Recommended)
The .pypirc file contained your PyPI API token. Since it's already published to PyPI successfully, we can:

1. Delete the local repository
2. Create a fresh clone from GitHub (after allowing the secret once)
3. Remove any sensitive files
4. Continue development

## Current Status:
- ✅ Package successfully published to PyPI
- ✅ All code is ready and clean
- ⚠️ Just need to get past GitHub's security check

## Next Steps After Push:
1. Create first GitHub release (v0.1.0)
2. Add repository topics
3. Update repository description
4. Set up branch protection
