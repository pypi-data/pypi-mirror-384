# Architecture/Any Decision Records

An ADR is a way to track decisions and their rationale in a way that is tied to
the source code, easy to digest, and written in a way that future us will
understand.  An ADR consists of several sections:

1. The title and ADR number (for easier sorting)
2. Context about the problem
3. The decision that was made and why
4. The status of implementation
5. Consequences of the implementation
6. Any references (especially if describing a science/software issue)
