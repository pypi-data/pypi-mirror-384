## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- **ðŸš€ Smart Anti-Truncation Engine**: Intelligent system to eliminate crude content truncation
  - **Priority-based File Classification**: Automatically categorizes files by importance (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

  - **Progressive Condensing**: 5-level adaptive compression system (none â†’ light â†’ moderate â†’ heavy â†’ maximum)
  - **Context-aware Chunking**: Preserves semantic boundaries and never breaks functions mid-implementation
  - **AST-based Code Analysis**: Deep understanding of Python, JavaScript, and Java code structures
  - **Import Graph Analysis**: Determines dependency importance for better prioritization
  - **Multi-language Support**: Extensible architecture for different programming languages
  - **Budget Optimization**: Maximizes information density within token constraints
- **Enhanced CLI Options**: New smart condensing flags
  - `--smart-condensing`: Enable intelligent content condensing
  - `--token-budget-strategy`: Choose allocation strategy (conservative/balanced/aggressive)
  - `--priority-analysis`: Control priority classification behavior
- **Streaming File Processing**: Handle large files without loading entire content into memory
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded file analysis using ThreadPoolExecutor for improved performance

- **Token Counting**: Configurable token limits for different LLM models with estimation methods
- **Enhanced Document Support**: Added support for RTF, Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files
- **Full .gitignore Compatibility**: Complete gitignore-style pattern matching including negation patterns
- **CLI Enhancements**: New options including `--token-limit`, `--char-limit`, `--max-tokens-per-chunk`, `--use-gitignore`
- **Ignore Template Generation**: `--init-ignore` flag to generate comprehensive .folder2md_ignore template
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Enhanced support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-specific dependencies
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Automated testing and PyPI publishing workflows
- **Tag-based Versioning**: Integrated hatch-vcs for automatic version management from git tags
- **Update Checker**: Optional automatic update notifications with caching support

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Minimum Python version requirement raised from 3.8 to 3.11
- **PDF Processing**: Upgraded from PyPDF2 to pypdf for better text extraction and performance
- **Configuration System**: Enhanced hierarchical YAML configuration with more options
- **File Type Detection**: Improved cross-platform file type detection using python-magic/python-magic-bin
- **CLI Interface**: More intuitive command-line options with better help text and validation
- **Error Handling**: Better cross-platform file system error handling and user feedback
- **Dependencies**: Updated to use modern, actively maintained libraries

### Fixed
- **Virtual Environment Filtering**: Properly exclude .venv directories in ignore patterns
- **Platform-specific Issues**: Resolved Windows compatibility issues with file paths and permissions
- **Memory Leaks**: Fixed memory issues when processing large repositories
- **Pattern Matching**: Corrected gitignore-style pattern matching edge cases

### Removed
- **Deprecated Dependencies**: Removed PyPDF2 in favor of pypdf
- **Legacy Python Support**: Dropped support for Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10
- **Redundant Workflows**: Removed build workflow in favor of streamlined testing and release workflows

## Development Notes

### Version 0.2.1+ Features

This version introduces significant performance and scalability improvements:

- **Streaming Architecture**: Files are processed in chunks rather than loaded entirely into memory
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple files can be processed simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Token Management**: Built-in token counting and estimation for LLM workflows
- **Enhanced Document Support**: Support for RTF, Jupyter notebooks, and PowerPoint files
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, automated releases, and professional documentation

### Breaking Changes in 0.2.1+

- **Python 3.11+ Required**: The minimum Python version has been raised to 3.11
- **Configuration Changes**: Some configuration options have been renamed or restructured
- **Dependency Updates**: Several dependencies have been updated to newer versions

### Migration Guide

To upgrade from version 0.2.0 to 0.2.1+:

1. **Update Python**: Ensure you're running Python 3.11 or later
2. **Update Dependencies**: Run `pip install --upgrade folder2md4llms`
3. **Review Configuration**: Check your `folder2md.yaml` files for any deprecated options
4. **Test Functionality**: Run the tool with `--verbose` flag to ensure all features work as expected
