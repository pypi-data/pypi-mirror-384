- **Enhanced Document Support**: Added support for RTF, Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files
- **Full .gitignore Compatibility**: Complete gitignore-style pattern matching including negation patterns
- **CLI Enhancements**: New options including `--token-limit`, `--char-limit`, `--max-tokens-per-chunk`, `--use-gitignore`
- **Ignore Template Generation**: `--init-ignore` flag to generate comprehensive .folder2md_ignore template

## Development Notes

### Version 0.2.1+ Features

This version introduces significant performance and scalability improvements:

- **Streaming Architecture**: Files are processed in chunks rather than loaded entirely into memory
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple files can be processed simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Token Management**: Built-in token counting and estimation for LLM workflows
- **Enhanced Document Support**: Support for RTF, Jupyter notebooks, and PowerPoint files
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, automated releases, and professional documentation

### Breaking Changes in 0.2.1+

- **Python 3.11+ Required**: The minimum Python version has been raised to 3.11
- **Configuration Changes**: Some configuration options have been renamed or restructured
- **Dependency Updates**: Several dependencies have been updated to newer versions

### Migration Guide

To upgrade from version 0.2.0 to 0.2.1+:

1. **Update Python**: Ensure you're running Python 3.11 or later
2. **Update Dependencies**: Run `pip install --upgrade folder2md4llms`
3. **Review Configuration**: Check your `folder2md.yaml` files for any deprecated options
4. **Test Functionality**: Run the tool with `--verbose` flag to ensure all features work as expected
