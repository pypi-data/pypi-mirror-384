`folder2md4llms` is a configurable tool that converts a repository's contents into a single, LLM-friendly Markdown file. It supports various file formats and provides options for content condensing and filtering.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Condensing**: Automatically condenses code to fit within a specified token or character limit without crude truncation.
- **Document Conversion**: Converts PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and other document formats into text.
- **Binary File Analysis**: Provides intelligent descriptions for images, archives, and other binary files.
- **Highly Configurable**: Use a `folder2md.yaml` file or command-line options to customize the output.
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses multi-threading for processing multiple files concurrently.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Uses `.gitignore`-style patterns to exclude files and directories.

## 🚀 Installation

> **⚠️ Requirements**: Python **3.11 or higher** is required.
>
> **Using Python 3.8-3.10?** Install the legacy version: `pipx install folder2md4llms==0.2.0`

```bash
# Check Python version first
python --version  # Must be 3.11+

# Using pipx (recommended)
pipx install folder2md4llms

# Or using pip
pip install folder2md4llms

# Verify installation
folder2md --help
```

> **Note:** Package name is `folder2md4llms`, command is `folder2md`


### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process the current directory and save to output.md
folder2md .

# Process a specific directory and set a token limit
folder2md /path/to/repo --limit 80000t

# Copy the output to the clipboard
folder2md /path/to/repo --clipboard

# Generate a .folder2md_ignore file
folder2md --init-ignore
```

For a full list of commands and options, see the [CLI Reference](docs/api.md) or run `folder2md --help`.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No matching distribution found for folder2md"**
- Use the correct package name: `folder2md4llms` (not `folder2md`)

**"Requires Python >=3.11" or incompatible Python version**
- Check your Python version: `python --version`
- If you have Python 3.8-3.10, use the legacy version: `pipx install folder2md4llms==0.2.0`
- To upgrade Python, see: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**"Command 'folder2md' not found"**
- Ensure pipx is installed: `pip install pipx`
- Try: `python -m folder2md4llms .`

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows: Use WSL2 (Recommended)

For Windows users, we recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for the best experience:

```bash
# Install WSL2 (run in PowerShell as Administrator)
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04

# Then follow the Linux installation instructions in WSL2
```

This provides better compatibility and performance compared to native Windows installation.
