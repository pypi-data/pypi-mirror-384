def comet_worker(func):
    """
    This decorator enables you to monitor resource usage for each distributed worker during a distributed training job.
    By applying this decorator, you can annotate any training function to integrate Cometâ€™s resource tracking.

    Note: This should be used together with the [comet_ml.integration.ray.CometTrainLoggerCallback][] callback,
    and the training function must accept a configuration dictionary as an input argument.

    Args:
        func (Callable): The training function to be wrapped which should have configuration dictionary as an input argument.
            The training function is a user-defined Python function that contains the end-to-end model training
            loop logic. When launching a distributed training job, each worker executes this training function.

    Example:
        ```python linenums="1"
        @comet_worker
        def train_func(config: Dict):
            # ray worker training code
        ```
