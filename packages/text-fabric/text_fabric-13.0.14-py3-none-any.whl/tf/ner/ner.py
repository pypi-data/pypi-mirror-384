"""Named Entity Recognition by Triggers.

As a preparation, read `tf.about.annotate` first, since it explains the concepts, and
guides you to set up the configuration for your corpus.

We explain here how to work with entity spreadsheets.

In a spreadsheet you can assign *triggers* to entities.
Triggers are strings to search for in the corpus.
You can limit the scope of these triggers to specific portions in the corpus.

The specification of the content and organization of such a entity sheet is in
`tf.ner.sheets.Sheets.readSheetData()`.

You can place entity sheets in the directory `ner/specs` at the toplevel of the repo,
or, if you are not working from the repo, you can look up the corpus
under your `text-fabric-data` directory, and find a `ner` directory there.

The output data of the tool ends up in the `_temp` directory, which ends up next
to the `ner` directory.

## For corpus designers

If you are a corpus designer, you can declare this `ner` directory as an extra
data module. Then it will packaged with the TF dataset of your corpus, and users
that use your corpus also get this directory, and can work with the NER tool
in the TF browser.

The way to declare this `ner` data module is by making sure that `app/config.yaml`
has this:

```
provenanceSpec:
    ...
    extraData: ner
    ...
```

Additionally, you can create a file `ner/config.yaml` with some settings for the
NER process. See `tf.ner.settings.Settings`.

You can also put a file `code.py` there in which you implement the function
`normalizeChars(string): string`

If you implement it, it will be invoked as a text transformation function upon
reading string data from spreadsheets.
The idea is that if the corpus is normalized for certain characters,
you can normalize the search terms and names in the spreadsheet in the
same way. For example, in the Suriano corpus, all incarnations of an
apostrophe, such as `‚Äô` or `'` or `‚Äò` have been normalized to `‚Äô`.
But the spreadsheet might still use the unwanted the variants.
By providing a suitable function you can prevent that.

## Starting up

### In the TF browser

On the command line say:

```
tf org/repo --tool=ner
```

If you are at the top level of the repo, you can even say

```
tf --tool=ner
```

Then use the chooser at the top right of the interface to select an annotation
set. There are three kinds of sets:

*   **=** The (readonly) set of entities that are already baked in into the TF dataset;
*   **üßæ** (readonly) sets of entities defined by a spreadsheet;
*   **üñçÔ∏è** (mutable) sets of entities created manually by the user with the NER tool
    in the TF browser.

![browser](../images/Ner/select2.png)

### In a program

Import the relevant Python modules:

``` python
from tf.app import use
```

Load your corpus. There are two ways:

*   Work with a local GitHub clone of the corpus in `~/HuygensING/suriano`:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano:clone", checkout="clone")

*   Or let TF auto-download the latest version and work with that:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano")

Load the `Ner` module:

``` python
NE = A.makeNer()
```

You can now load a spreadsheet by

``` python
NE.setTask(".people")
```

**N.B.:** The leading `.` in the name signifies that this set is coupled with a
spreadsheet.

## Trigger investigations

We now assume that you are working with a program, ideally in a Jupyter notebook.

There are a few rule in trigger based entity search:

*   the corpus is searched from beginning to end;
*   if at some place in the corpus multiple triggers match, the longest match
    counts, and the others are discarded;
*   if at some place, a trigger has matched, searching continues past the end of
    the match.

A consequence of these rules is that at no token in the corpus is part of a double
match.

The idea behind this is that if you have two triggers, that the more specific trigger
takes precedence above the lesser specific one.

However, the rules also have some pitfalls, which can lead to triggers that
have unexpectedly no results, or less results than expected.

Here are a few caveats:

*   Overlapping triggers: if you have the following triggers:

    *   `the mayor`
    *   `mayor of London`

    then the second one looks more specific than the first one. but if you have this
    passage in the corpus:

    `the mayor of London`

    then `mayor of London` will not be found. Because before it can be found,
    `the mayor` will be found, after which searching continues at `of London`, and
    this does not match the trigger `mayor of London`.

    The solution to cases like this is: `the mayor` is a rather generic trigger, and
    it will only be valid in specific spots in the corpus.

    So add a scope to this trigger, and make sure that `the mayor of London` is outside
    that scope.

When the entity spreadsheet is big, with over a thousand triggers for hundreds of names,
it is difficult to keep track of all the tricky interactions between triggers.

For that reason we have a few diagnostic functions that help you to spot them:

*   `tf.ner.triggers.Triggers.triggerInterference()` will list the triggers belonging to
    different entities that overlap and for which there are occurrences where this
    overlap is problematic;

*   `tf.ner.triggers.Triggers.reportHits()` will list the triggers without hits
    while they do occur in the corpus; it will give diagnostic info about those
    triggers; it also produces statistics about the inventory of entities that
    has been collected on the basis of the triggers; finally it produces a file
    that lists the number of hits per entity, per trigger, per scope and per
    section where the occurrences have been found.

    """API for Named Entity marking.

    This class is the central class of the trigger based Named Entity
    Recognition tool whose main task is to find occurrences of annotations on
    the basis of criteria.

    This class inherits from a number of other classes:

    *   `tf.ner.sheets`: manage annotation spreadsheets;
    *   `tf.ner.sets`: manage annotation sets;
    *   `tf.ner.show`: generate HTML for annotated buckets of the corpus;

    In turn, these classes inherit from yet other classes:

    *   `tf.ner.sets`:
        *   from `tf.ner.data`: manage the annotation data in various
            convenient representations;
    *   `tf.ner.data`:
        *   from `tf.ner.corpus`: manage the corpus dependent bits; it uses
            the TF machinery to extract the specifics of the corpus;
    *   `tf.ner.corpus`:
        *   from `tf.ner.settings`: additional settings, some of which
            derive from a config file;
    *   `tf.ner.sheets`:
        *   from `tf.ner.scopes`: support the concept of scope in the corpus;
        *   from `tf.ner.triggers`: support the concept of trigger.

    The NER machinery can be used by

    *   users to manipulate annotations in their own programs, especially in a
        Jupyter notebook.
    *   `tf.browser.ner.web`: Flask app that routes URLs to controller functions.

    The browsing experience is supported by:

    *   `tf.browser.ner.web`: map urls to the controllers of the web app
    *   `tf.browser.ner.serve`: implement the controllers of the web app
    *   `tf.browser.ner.request`: manage the data of a request;
    *   `tf.browser.ner.form`: retrieve form values into typed and structured values.
    *   `tf.browser.ner.fragments`: generate HTML for widgets on the page;
    *   `tf.browser.ner.websettings`: settings for the browser experience;
    *   `tf.browser.html`: a generic library to generate HTML using Pythonic syntax.

        """Top level functions for entity annotation.

        This is a high-level class, building on the lower-level tools provided
        by the Sheets, Sets and Show classes on which it is based and on the classes
        that these are based on in turn.

        These methods can be used by code that runs in the TF browser
        and by code that runs in a Jupyter notebook.

        Entities are collected in sets. There are three kind of sets:

        *   entities that are already part of the TF data as nodes and features; this
            is a *readonly* set. However, you can duplicate it, and the copy is a
            modifiable set;

        *   entities that have been looked up on the basis of triggers specified in a
            spreadsheet; these are also *readonly* sets, and also these can be
            duplicated in modifiable sets;

        *   entities that have been found by hand; these are *modifiable* sets.

        The concept of entity *task* stands for entity sets, of all three kinds.
        In shorthand, we say a task is either a set, or a sheet, or the given
        entity set.

        Underneath, the given entity set looks like a set, but in fact there is
        no other representation of them than the nodes and features that are already
        in the TF dataset.

        Sheets have  corresponding sets, but there is a bit of logic around sheets
        that prevent the set from being modified, among other things.

        Sets are the lowest level of data corresponding to entities.

        This class handles *tasks*, which is an abstraction of the three concepts of
        entity collections.

        It does not handle HTML generation, but its parent class, `Show`, does that.

        We consider the corpus as a list of buckets (lowest level sectional
        units; in TEI-derived corpora called `chunk`, being generalizations of
        `p` (paragraph) elements). We read this type off from the TF dataset,
