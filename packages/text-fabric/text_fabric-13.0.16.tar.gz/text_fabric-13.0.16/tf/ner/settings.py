"""CSS style configuration for entity features.

Here we define properties of the styling of the entity features and their
values.
Since these features are defined in configuration, we cannot work with a fixed
style sheet.

We divide entity features in *keyword* features and *free* features.
The typical keyword feature is `kind`, it has a limited set of values.
The typical free feature is `eid`, it has an unbounded number of values.

As it is now, we could have expressed this in a fixed style sheet.
But if we open up to allowing for more entity features, we can use this setup
to easily configure the formatting of them.

However, we should move these definitions to the `ner.yaml` file then, so that the
only place of configuration is that YAML file, and not this file.

        """Provides configuration details.

        There is fixed configuration, that is not intended to be modifiable by users.
        These configuration values are put in variables in this module, which
        other modules can import.

        There is also customisable configuration, meant to adapt the tool to the
        specifics of a corpus.
        Those configuration values are read from a YAML file *config.yaml*,
        located in a directory `ner` next to the `tf` data of the corpus.

        This file has the following information:

        *   `entityType`: the node type of entities that are already in the corpus,
            possibly generated by a tool like Spacy;

        *   `entitySet`: a name for the pre-existing set of entities;

        *   `lineType`: the name of the node type for individual lines; this is needed
            to deal with words that are split across a line boundary;

        *   `strFeature`: the name of the feature that has the string values of tokens;

        *   `afterFeature`: the name of the feature that has the string values of the
            text between tokens, usually a space, it is on the preceding token;

        *   `features`: the features that contain essential information about
            the entities. Currently, we specify only 2 features. You may rename these
            features, but we advise not modify the number of features.
            Probably, in later releases, you'll have more choice here.

        *   `keywordFeatures`: some features have a limited set of values, e.g.
            the kind of entity. Those features are mentioned under this key.

        *   `defaultValues`: provide default values for the keyword features.
            The tool also provides a default for the first feature, the entity
            identifier, basically a lower case version of the full name where
            the parts of the name are separated by dots.

        *   `featureMeta`: metadata of the features specified in `features`;

        *   `eNameFeature`: the name and metadata of the feature that has the
            full name of an entity; this is only available for annotation sets
            that correspond to a NER sheet;

        *   `spaceEscaped`: set this to True if your corpus has tokens with
            spaces in it.
            You can then escape spaces with `_`, for example in spreadsheets where you
            specify annotation instructions.

        *   `transform`: the tool can read a spreadsheet with full names and per name
            a list of occurrences that should be marked as entities for that name.
            When the full name is turned into an identifier, the identifier might
            become longer than is convenient. Here you can specify a replacement
            table for name parts. You can use it to shorten or repress certain
            name parts that are very generic, such as `de`, `van`, `von`.

        *   `variants`: for sheet-based sets, the tool can compute spelling variants
            of the triggers. This is done by *analiticcl*. Here the parameters for
            running that program are specified. See `tf.ner.variants`
