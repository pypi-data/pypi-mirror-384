### Initial Start-Up

Initial Start-Up is the time the ENS160 needs to exhibit reasonable air quality readings after
its first ever power-on.
The ENS160 sensor raw resistance signals and sensitivities will change upon first power-on.
The change in resistance is greatest in the first 48 hours of operation. Therefore, the ENS160
employs a start-up algorithm, allowing eCO2-, TVOC- and AQI-output signals to be used from
first power-on after 1 hour of operation.

### Warm-Up

Further to “Initial Start-Up” the conditioning or “Warm-Up” period is the time required to
achieve adequate sensor stability before measuring VOCs after idle periods or power-off.
Typically, the ENS160 requires 1 minute of warm-up before reasonable air quality readings
can be expected.
