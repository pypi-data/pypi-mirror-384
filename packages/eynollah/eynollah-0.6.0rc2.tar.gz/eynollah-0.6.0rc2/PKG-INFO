              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

:warning: Development is currently focused on achieving the best possible quality of results for a wide variety of 
historical documents and therefore processing can be very slow. We aim to improve this, but contributions are welcome.

## Installation

Python `3.8-3.11` with Tensorflow `<2.13` on Linux are currently supported.

For (limited) GPU support the CUDA toolkit needs to be installed.

You can either install from PyPI

```
pip install eynollah
```

or clone the repository, enter it and install (editable) with

```
git clone git@github.com:qurator-spk/eynollah.git
cd eynollah; pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make install` or `make install-dev` for editable installation.

To also install the dependencies for the OCR engines:

```
pip install "eynollah[OCR]"
# or
make install EXTRAS=OCR
```

## Models
Pretrained models can be downloaded from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17194824) or [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/SBB?search_models=eynollah). 

For documentation on methods and models, have a look at [`models.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/models.md).

## Train

In case you want to train your own model with Eynollah, have a look at [`train.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/train.md).

## Usage

Eynollah supports five use cases: layout analysis (segmentation), binarization,
image enhancement, text recognition (OCR), and (trainable) reading order detection.

### Layout Analysis

The layout analysis module is responsible for detecting layouts, identifying text lines, and determining reading order 
using both heuristic methods or a machine-based reading order detection model. 

Note that there are currently two supported ways for reading order detection: either as part of layout analysis based 
on image input, or, currently under development, for given layout analysis results based on PAGE-XML data as input.

The command-line interface for layout analysis can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah layout \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -o <output directory> \
  -m <directory containing model files> \
     [OPTIONS]
```

The following options can be used to further configure the processing:

| option            | description                                                                    |
|-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-fl`             | full layout analysis including all steps and segmentation classes              |
| `-light`          | lighter and faster but simpler method for main region detection and deskewing  |
| `-tll`            | this indicates the light textline and should be passed with light version      |
| `-tab`            | apply table detection                                                          |
| `-ae`             | apply enhancement (the resulting image is saved to the output directory)       |
| `-as`             | apply scaling                                                                  |
| `-cl`             | apply contour detection for curved text lines instead of bounding boxes        |
| `-ib`             | apply binarization (the resulting image is saved to the output directory)      |
| `-ep`             | enable plotting (MUST always be used with `-sl`, `-sd`, `-sa`, `-si` or `-ae`) |
| `-eoi`            | extract only images to output directory (other processing will not be done)    |
| `-ho`             | ignore headers for reading order dectection                                    |
| `-si <directory>` | save image regions detected to this directory                                  |
| `-sd <directory>` | save deskewed image to this directory                                          |
| `-sl <directory>` | save layout prediction as plot to this directory                               |
| `-sp <directory>` | save cropped page image to this directory                                      |
| `-sa <directory>` | save all (plot, enhanced/binary image, layout) to this directory               |

If no option is set, the tool performs layout detection of main regions (background, text, images, separators 
and marginals).
The best output quality is produced when RGB images are used as input rather than greyscale or binarized images.

### Binarization

The binarization module performs document image binarization using pretrained pixelwise segmentation models. 

The command-line interface for binarization of single image can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah binarization \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -o <output directory> \
  -m <directory containing model files> \
```

### OCR

The OCR module performs text recognition from images using two main families of pretrained models: CNN-RNN–based OCR and Transformer-based OCR.

The command-line interface for ocr can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah ocr \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -dx <directory of xmls> \
  -o <output directory> \
  -m <path to directory containing model files> | --model_name <path to specific model> \
```

### Machine-based-reading-order

The machine-based reading-order module employs a pretrained model to identify the reading order from layouts represented in PAGE-XML files.

The command-line interface for machine based reading order can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah machine-based-reading-order \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -xml <xml file name> | -dx <directory containing xml files> \
  -m <path to directory containing model files> \
  -o <output directory> 
```

#### Use as OCR-D processor

Eynollah ships with a CLI interface to be used as [OCR-D](https://ocr-d.de) [processor](https://ocr-d.de/en/spec/cli),
formally described in [`ocrd-tool.json`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/src/eynollah/ocrd-tool.json).

In this case, the source image file group with (preferably) RGB images should be used as input like this:

    ocrd-eynollah-segment -I OCR-D-IMG -O OCR-D-SEG -P models eynollah_layout_v0_5_0

If the input file group is PAGE-XML (from a previous OCR-D workflow step), Eynollah behaves as follows:
- existing regions are kept and ignored (i.e. in effect they might overlap segments from Eynollah results)
- existing annotation (and respective `AlternativeImage`s) are partially _ignored_:
  - previous page frame detection (`cropped` images)
  - previous derotation (`deskewed` images)
  - previous thresholding (`binarized` images)
- if the page-level image nevertheless deviates from the original (`@imageFilename`)
  (because some other preprocessing step was in effect like `denoised`), then
  the output PAGE-XML will be based on that as new top-level (`@imageFilename`)

    ocrd-eynollah-segment -I OCR-D-XYZ -O OCR-D-SEG -P models eynollah_layout_v0_5_0

Still, in general, it makes more sense to add other workflow steps **after** Eynollah.

There is also an OCR-D processor for the binarization:

    ocrd-sbb-binarize -I OCR-D-IMG -O OCR-D-BIN -P models default-2021-03-09
