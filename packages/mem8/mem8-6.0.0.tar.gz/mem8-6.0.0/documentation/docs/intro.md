# Welcome to Codebase Context

**Tools and Techniques for AI Development Workflows**

Codebase Context is a collection of tools and approaches for managing AI context windows, memory, and development workflows. mem8 is the primary CLI tool that helps bridge the gaps between AI capabilities and developer needs.

:::info Historical Note
The original [codebase-context-spec](https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/codebase-context-spec) project is **archived and no longer maintained or supported**. mem8 represents the current, actively developed implementation of these concepts.
:::

## What is mem8?

mem8 addresses common challenges in AI-assisted development:

- 🧠 **Context Window Management** - Persistent memory across long development sessions
- 📝 **Structured Thoughts** - Organize research, plans, and decisions in searchable markdown
- 🔧 **Toolbelt Integration** - Install and manage development tools seamlessly
- 🚢 **Port Management** - Intelligent detection and resolution of port conflicts
- 🤖 **Claude Code Enhancement** - Custom agents, commands, and workflows via plugins
- 🎨 **External Plugins** - Share workflows and standards across teams
- 🔍 **Universal Search** - Find information across all your documentation

## Quick Start

### 1. Install mem8 CLI

```bash
# Install with uv (fast, modern Python package manager)
uv tool install mem8
```

:::tip Install uv first
If you don't have uv installed:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
:::

### 2. Install Claude Code Plugin

For workflow commands and specialized agents:

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugin install mem8@mem8-official
```

This provides:
- 8 workflow commands (`/mem8:research`, `/mem8:plan`, `/mem8:implement`, etc.)
- 6 specialized agents (codebase-analyzer, memory-locator, etc.)

See the [mem8-plugin repository](https://github.com/killerapp/mem8-plugin) for details.

### 3. Use mem8 Commands

```bash
# Check version
mem8 --version

# Check workspace status
mem8 status

# Search your memory
mem8 search "authentication"
```
