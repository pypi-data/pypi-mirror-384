# Command Visualizer

Explore the mem8 command ecosystem through interactive visualizations. Understand complexity, dependencies, and workflow patterns.

## Interactive Exploration

## Understanding the Visualizations

### ðŸ“Š Pyramid View
Shows commands arranged by complexity level. Higher commands are more complex and use more parallel agents.

- **Top tier (9)**: m8-research - Full research orchestration with 5+ parallel agents
- **High tier (7-8)**: m8-debug, m8-validate - Multi-agent investigation and verification
- **Mid tier (5-6)**: m8-implement, m8-describe-pr - Implementation and integration
- **Low tier (3-4)**: Utility commands for setup and workflow support

### ðŸ”„ Workflows
Four common workflow patterns showing how commands chain together:

- **Full Lifecycle**: Complete development cycle from research to PR
- **Quick Fix**: Rapid debug â†’ implement â†’ commit flow
- **Research**: Deep dive into codebase understanding
- **Code Review**: Colleague branch review workflow

### ðŸ“‹ Matrix
Command dependency matrix showing which commands create input for others. A checkmark (âœ“) indicates that the row command's output can serve as input for the column command.

### ðŸ“ˆ Scatter Plot
Visualizes the relationship between complexity and autonomy. Commands in the upper right are both complex and highly autonomous (can discover context independently).

## Command Tiers

### Synthesis & Orchestration (7-9)
These commands spawn multiple parallel agents to gather, analyze, and synthesize information:
- **m8-research**: 5+ specialized agents (codebase-locator, analyzer, pattern-finder, memory-locator, analyzer, web-search)
- **m8-validate**: 3+ verification agents (DB, code, test verifiers)
- **m8-debug**: 3 investigation agents (log analyzer, DB inspector, git inspector)

### Integration & Orchestration (5-6)
Single-purpose orchestration with some parallelization:
- **m8-implement**: Executes implementation plans with context
- **m8-describe-pr**: Multi-system integration for PR documentation

### Automation & Utility (3-4)
Workflow automation and support:
- **m8-plan**: Creates implementation plans
- **m8-commit**: Analyzes and creates commits
- **m8-local-review**: Sets up worktrees for code review

## Key Insights

- **Parallelization drives complexity**: The most complex commands (research, validate, debug) all spawn multiple parallel agents
- **Natural workflow progression**: Commands are designed to feed into each other
- **Context accumulation**: Higher complexity commands build on outputs from simpler commands
- **Synthesis is key**: Top-tier commands excel at combining information from multiple sources
