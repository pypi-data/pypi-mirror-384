# MQT SyReC Synthesizer - A Tool for HDL-based Synthesis of Reversible Circuits

MQT SyReC Synthesizer is a tool for HDL-based synthesis of reversible circuits.
It is part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key Features

- **Automatic synthesis of reversible circuits from high-level HDL**: Accepts any HDL description following the [SyReC grammar and syntax](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/syrec/en/latest/SyrecLanguageSemantics.html), enabling rapid prototyping and design of reversible logic.
- **Two complementary synthesis schemes**: Choose between [cost-aware synthesis](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/syrec/en/latest/DescriptionAndFeatures.html#cost-aware-synthesis) (minimizing gate cost) and [line-aware synthesis](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/syrec/en/latest/DescriptionAndFeatures.html#line-aware-synthesis) (minimizing circuit lines), each with distinct trade-offs for resource optimization.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Intuitive GUI for specifying SyReC programs, visualizing circuits, and running synthesis, simulation, and cost analysis at the click of a button.
- **Simulation and cost analysis**: Simulate synthesized circuits and determine gate costs directly within the tool.
- **Comprehensive SyReC language support**: Implements the full SyReC language, including modules, parameterized bitwidths, multi-dimensional variables, and advanced assignment semantics ([language reference](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/syrec/en/latest/SyrecLanguageSemantics.html)).
- **Python API and C++ core**: High-performance C++ backend with Python bindings for integration into research and teaching workflows.
- **Cross-platform and easy to install**: Prebuilt Python wheels for Linux, macOS, and Windows via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.syrec/).

## Getting Started

`mqt.syrec` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.syrec/).

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.syrec
```

Once installed, start the GUI by running:

```console
(.venv) $ syrec-editor
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/syrec).**

## System Requirements

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.24 or newer.
For details on how to build the project, please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/syrec).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT SyReC Synthesizer is compatible with all [officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
