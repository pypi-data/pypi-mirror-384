        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TIS AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND

        TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF 
        LACK OF VIRUSES ALL WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or 
        limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to CUSTOMER in its entirety.
        
        9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
        
        9.1 TIS SHALL SOLELY BE LIABLE, WITHOUT LIMTIATION, FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM 
        (i) INJURY, BODILY HARM OR LOSS OF LIFE DUE TO A NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL BREACH OF DUTY BY TIS OR TIS's REPRESENTATIVES, 
        (ii) ANY VIOLIATION OF AN OBLIGATION WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT (Kardinalspflicht) AND/OR 
        (iii) A GROSSLY NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY TIS OR TIS's REPRESENTATIVES.
        
        9.2 TIS's LIABILITY UNDER THE PRODUCT LIABILITY ACT (ProdHaftG) REMAINS UNAFFECTED.
        
        9.3 IN ALL OTHER CASES THAN THE AFOREMENTIONED, TIS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WETHER OR NOT SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR 
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES) INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS 
        INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE
        PRODUCT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF TIS OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
        OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES OCCUR AS A RESULT OF AN INTENTIONAL BREACH OF 
        THIS AGREEMENT BY TIS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES.
        
        9.4 In cases of any breach of contract by TIS, for which the liability of TIS is not excluded under Section 9.3 above, TIS's liability 
        shall be limited to the amount of damages foreseeable under and typical for the Agreement.
        
        10. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.
        
        10.1 This AGREEMENT shall be considered to have been entered into and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, excluding its 
        provisions on the conflict of laws and the CISG rules. For all controversies between the parties or claims based on this AGREEMENT the 
        District Court Bremen shall have jurisdiction. Failure by either party to enforce any term of this AGREEMENT shall not be deemed to be 
        a waiver of future enforcement of that term or any other term.
        
        10.2 CUSTOMER agree that this AGREEMENT shall be enforceable in a court of equity and acknowledges that a breach by CUSTOMER of the terms 
        of this AGREEMENT may not be adequately remedied by an award of damages and that TIS shall therefore be entitled to injunctive or other 
        equitable relief in the event of such breach. CUSTOMER further agree that the election by TIS to seek equitable relief shall not preclude 
        it from also seeking relief at law.
        
        11. GENERAL.
        
        11.1 This AGREEMENT is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and 
        communications with respect to the subject matter. This AGREEMENT shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto 
        and their respective successors and assigns.
        
        11.2 This AGREEMENT can only be modified by a written document signed by both parties.
        
        11.3 If any provision of this AGREEMENT is held invalid, the offending clause will be deleted and replaced by a clause which is valid and 
        comes as close as possible to the offended clause. In any case the invalidity of one or more clauses shall not affect the validity of the 
        remaining clauses and the remainder of this AGREEMENT will continue in full force and effect.
