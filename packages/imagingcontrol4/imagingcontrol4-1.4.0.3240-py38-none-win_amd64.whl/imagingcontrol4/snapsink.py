class SnapSink(Sink):
    """The snap sink is a sink implementation that allows a program to capture single images or sequences of images
    on demand, while still having a display showing all images.

    Pass the sink to :py:meth:`.Grabber.stream_setup` to feed images into the sink.

    To grab a single image out of the stream, call :py:meth:`.snap_single`. To grab a sequence of images, call
    :py:meth:`.snap_sequence`.

    The snap sink manages the buffers used for background image aquisition as well as for the grabbed images.
    During stream setup, a number of buffers is allocated depending on the configured allocation strategy.
    Additional buffers can be automatically created on demand, if the allocation strategy allows.
    Likewise, if there is a surplus of unused image buffers, unused buffers are reclaimed and released automatically.

    Image buffers that were returned by one of the snap functions are owned by their respective caller through
    the reference to the :py:class:`.ImageBuffer`.
    To return the image buffer to the sink for reuse, let the variable go out of scope, or call
    :py:meth:`.ImageBuffer.release` on the image buffer.

    Please note that if there are no buffers available in the sink when the device tries to deliver a frame,
    the frame will be dropped. Use :py:attr:`.Grabber.StreamStatistics` to find out whether a buffer underrun occurred.

    Args:
        strategy (Optional[AllocationStrategy]): An optional buffer allocation strategy for the sink.
                                                 If this is `None`, a default allocation strategy is used.
        accepted_pixel_formats (List[PixelFormat]): An optional list of pixel formats that restrict the input to this
                                                    sink. This can be used to force an automatic conversion from the
                                                    device's pixel format to a pixel format usable by the sink.
