class BufferPool:
    """The buffer pool allows allocating additional buffers for use by the program.

    Most programs will only use buffers provided by one of the sink types.
    However, some programs require additional buffers, for example to use as destination for image processing.

    To create additional buffers, first create a buffer pool.
    Then, use :py:meth:`.BufferPool.get_buffer` to request a new buffer with a specified image type.

    When an image buffer is no longer required, call :py:meth:`.ImageBuffer.release` on it, or let it go out of scope.
    The image buffer will then be returned to the buffer pool.

    The buffer pool has configurable caching behavior. By default, the buffer pool will cache one image buffer and
    return it the next time a matching image buffer is requested.

    Image buffers objects created by the buffer pool are still valid after the buffer pool itself has been disposed.

    Args:
        cache_buffers_max (int): Maximum number of frames to keep in the buffer pool's cache
        cache_bytes_max (int): Maximum size of the buffer pool cache in bytes, or 0 to not limit by size

    Raises:
        IC4Exception: An error occurred. Check :attr:`.IC4Exception.code` and :attr:`.IC4Exception.message` for details.
