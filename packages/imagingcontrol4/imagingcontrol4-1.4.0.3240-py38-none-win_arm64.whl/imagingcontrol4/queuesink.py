class QueueSink(Sink):
    """A sink implementation that allows a program to process all images received from a video capture device

    A queue sink manages a number of buffers that are organized in two queues:

    - A free queue that buffers are pulled from to fill with data from the device
    - An output queue that contains the filled buffers ready to be picked up by the program

    Pass the sink to :py:meth:`.Grabber.stream_setup` to feed images into the sink.

    The sink is interacted with by implementing the abstract methods in the :py:class:`.QueueSinkListener` passed to
    the queue sink during creation.
    The methods are called at different significant points in the lifetime of a queue sink:

    - :py:meth:`.QueueSinkListener.sink_connected` is called when a data stream is being set up from the device to
      the sink. The event handler is responsible for making sure there are enough buffers queued for streaming to begin.
    - :py:meth:`.QueueSinkListener.frames_queued` is called whenever there are images available in the output queue.
    - :py:meth:`.QueueSinkListener.sink_disconnected` is called when a previously-created data stream is stopped.

    To retrieve the oldest available image from the output queue, call :py:meth:`.QueueSink.pop_output_buffer`.
    The returned image buffer is owned by the program. If the program no longer needs the image buffer,
    the image buffer object must be deleted, or :py:meth:`.ImageBuffer.release` must be called it to return
    the image buffer to the sink's free queue.

    A program does not necessarily have to requeue all image buffers immediately; it can choose keep references to a
    number of them in its own data structures. However, please note that if there are no buffers in the free queue
    when the device tries to deliver a frame, the frame will be dropped. Use :py:attr:`.Grabber.stream_statistics`
    to find out whether a buffer underrun occurred.

    Args:
        listener (QueueSinkListener): An object implementing the :py:class:`.QueueSinkListener` abstract base class
                                      controlling the sink's behavior.
        accepted_pixel_formats (List[PixelFormat]): An optional list of pixel formats that restrict the input to this
                                                    sink. This can be used to force an automatic conversion from the
                                                    device's pixel format to a pixel format usable by the sink.
        max_output_buffers (int): Defines the maximum number of buffers that are stored in the sink's output queue.
                                  If set to 0, the number of buffers is unlimited.
                                  If a new frame arrives at the sink, and the output queue size would exceed this
                                  number, the oldest image is discarded and its buffer is added to the free queue.
