Description: Tracking export-limit through variable load
Category: DER
Classes:
  - DER-G

TargetVersions:
  - v1.2
  - v1.3-beta/storage

Criteria:
  checks:
    - type: all-steps-complete
      parameters: {}

Preconditions:
  init_actions:
    - type: set-comms-rate
      parameters:
        dcap_poll_seconds: 60
        edev_list_poll_seconds: 60
        fsa_list_poll_seconds: 60

  checks:
    - type: end-device-contents
      parameters: {}
    - type: der-settings-contents
      parameters: {}
  actions:
    - type: create-der-control
      parameters:
        start: $(now)
        duration_seconds: 60
        opModExpLimW: $(setMaxW * 2)
    - type: create-der-control
      parameters:
        start: $(now + '1 minute')
        duration_seconds: 420
        opModExpLimW: $(setMaxW * 0.2)
  instructions:
    - Connect a test load electrically in parallel with the DER.
    - Set the load to consume 0W.

Steps:

  # This test is purely following a sequence of DERControls. It's expected that the following events occurs out of band:
  # at t=0 - Test load is consuming 0W
  # at t=120s - Test load is consuming 20% of setMaxW
  # at t=240s - Test load is consuming 10% of setMaxW
  # at t=360s - Test load is consuming 0W
  #
  # Validation MUST be performed by power meter to ensure that the DER is adjusting its power in response to changing 
  # loads
  WAIT-TEST-END:
    instructions:
      - At t=120s, set the load to consume 20% of the DER's rated active power.
      - At t=240s, set the load to consume 10% of the DER's rated active power.
      - At t=360s, set the load to consume 0W.
