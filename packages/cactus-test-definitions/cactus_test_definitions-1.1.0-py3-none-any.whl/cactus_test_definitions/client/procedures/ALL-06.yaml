Preconditions:
  immediate_start: true # There will be no "init" phase - all interactions will be immediately logged against the test
  init_actions:
    - type: set-comms-rate
      parameters:
        dcap_poll_seconds: 60
        edev_list_poll_seconds: 60

        derp_list_poll_seconds: 60
        mup_post_seconds: 60
  instructions:
    - Connect a test load electrically in parallel with the DER.
    - Set the load to consume 25% of the DER's rated active power.
