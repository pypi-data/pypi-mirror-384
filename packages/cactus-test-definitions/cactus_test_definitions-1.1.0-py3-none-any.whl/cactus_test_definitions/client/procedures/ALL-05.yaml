Preconditions:
  immediate_start: true # There will be no "init" phase - all interactions will be immediately logged against the test

Criteria:
  checks:

      parameters: {}

# Note - these steps aren't annotated with the TS 5573 test procedure steps due to them having some dubious
# references to links appearing in the wrong entities / unusual ordering
# 
# The steps still represent the "intended" interpretation of a client continuing to undergo normal in band registration
# despite the EndDevice registration links being removed.
