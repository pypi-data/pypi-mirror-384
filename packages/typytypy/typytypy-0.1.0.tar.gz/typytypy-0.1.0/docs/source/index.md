# TypyTypy *(typytypy-py)*

*— A Bespoke Character-by-Character Text Printer.*

> *[click-clack-clack...]*

A utility Python library which provides for a realistic, "real-time typing" simulation with highly configurable implementations. It features a flexible API for both simple and advanced use, quick-use "character personality" presets, and granular timing control for creating custom text presentations with authentic temporal dynamics.

*Born of the [KitschCode](https://github.com/VDundDB/KitschCode-py) philosophy of applying meticulous craftsmanship to humble functionality.*

```{admonition} Note - BETA release
*TypyTypy* is currently still in **BETA** release (but hopefully that changes soon). Notwithstanding, *TypyTypy* has a comprehensive test suite (100% statement and branch coverage with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)), is [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)-linted, [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)-formatted, and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) type-checked.

### > Developer-Focused API

- 🎯 **Simple Direct Usage**: Get started with a single function call: `typytypy.type_out("Hello, World!")`.
- 📊 **Layered Design**: A flexible API offers both module-level convenience functions and advanced, object-oriented instance management.

### > Expressive Typing Engine

- 🎭 **Character Personalities**: Simulate distinct typing styles with built-in presets like `NERVOUS`, `CONFIDENT`, and `ROBOTIC`.
- ⏱️ **Granular Timing Control**: Define custom timing profiles to precisely control typing rhythm for specific keywords.
- 👁️‍🗨️ **High-Fidelity Output**: Renders text as "real-time typing" simulation, perfectly preserving all original formatting, spacing, and line breaks.

### > Professional-Grade Foundation

- ⚡ **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation for a lightweight and hassle-free integration.
