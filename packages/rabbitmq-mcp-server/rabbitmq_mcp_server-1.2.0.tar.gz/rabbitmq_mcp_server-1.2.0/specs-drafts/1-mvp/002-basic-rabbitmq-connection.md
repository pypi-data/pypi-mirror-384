# SPEC-002: Basic RabbitMQ Connection

## Overview
Basic connection and management system for RabbitMQ using AMQP protocol with essential authentication and health monitoring.

## Components

### Connection Management
- **Connection Establishment**: Connect to RabbitMQ via AMQP
- **Connection Pooling**: Basic connection pool for multiple operations
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Connect, maintain, and disconnect operations
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on connection loss

### Authentication
- **Username/Password**: Primary authentication method
- **Virtual Host Support**: Connect to specific vhosts
- **Connection Parameters**: Host, port, credentials configuration

### Health Monitoring
- **Health Check**: Basic RabbitMQ availability check
- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection state monitoring
- **Error Detection**: Connection failure detection and reporting

### Internal Operations (Accessed via `call-id` tool)
- **AMQP Protocol Operations** (NOT in OpenAPI, manually implemented):
  - `amqp.connect`: Establish AMQP connection to RabbitMQ
  - `amqp.disconnect`: Close current AMQP connection
  - `amqp.health-check`: Check RabbitMQ availability via AMQP
- **HTTP API Operations** (auto-generated from OpenAPI):
  - `health.get-overview`: Get RabbitMQ cluster overview
  - `health.check-aliveness`: Check vhost aliveness
  - `nodes.list`: List cluster nodes and status

## Technical Requirements

### Connection Parameters
- Host: localhost (default)
- Port: 5672 (default AMQP port)
- Username/Password: Configurable
- Virtual Host: / (default)
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds

### Performance
- Connection establishment < 5 seconds
- Health check response < 1 second
- Connection recovery < 10 seconds

### Error Handling
- Connection timeout handling
- Authentication failure handling
- Network error recovery
- Graceful connection cleanup

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Successfully connects to RabbitMQ with valid credentials
- [ ] Maintains stable connection during operations
- [ ] Detects and reports connection failures
- [ ] Performs health checks accurately
- [ ] Handles authentication failures gracefully

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Connection establishment completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Health checks respond within 1 second
- [ ] Connection recovery completes within 10 seconds

### Error Handling Requirements
- [ ] Proper error messages for connection failures
- [ ] Graceful handling of network timeouts
- [ ] Clean connection cleanup on disconnect

## Dependencies
- pika (RabbitMQ Python client)
- asyncio for concurrent operations
- structlog for connection logging

## Implementation Notes
- Use pika for AMQP connection management (AMQP protocol operations)
- Use requests/httpx for RabbitMQ Management API operations (HTTP API)
- Implement connection pooling for efficiency
- **CRITICAL**: Connection operations accessed through semantic discovery pattern (`call-id` tool)
- **AMQP vs HTTP**: AMQP operations for message handling, HTTP API for management
- Log all connection events for debugging using structlog
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- **Security**: Sanitize credentials in logs automatically (constitution requirement)
- **Structured Logging**: Use structlog with JSON format for all connection events
