### Internal Operations (Server Configuration, NOT MCP tools)
**Note**: Performance configuration is server-side infrastructure, not exposed as MCP tools.

- `performance.get-metrics`: Get current performance metrics (Prometheus /metrics endpoint)
- `performance.configure-cache`: Configure caching settings (server config file)
- `performance.set-circuit-breaker`: Configure circuit breaker settings (server config)
- `performance.optimize-connections`: Optimize connection pool settings (server config)
