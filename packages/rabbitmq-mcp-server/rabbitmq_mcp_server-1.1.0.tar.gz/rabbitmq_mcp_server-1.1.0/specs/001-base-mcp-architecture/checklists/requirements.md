# Specification Quality Checklist: Base MCP Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on user needs (developers using the MCP server)
- ✅ Written from user perspective without technical implementation details
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ No clarification markers needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- ✅ All functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-010 specifies <10ms validation time)
- ✅ Success criteria include measurable metrics (SC-001: <5 seconds, SC-002: <200ms, SC-004: <1GB memory)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic and user-focused
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- ✅ Edge cases cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
- ✅ Scope is well-defined with clear boundaries (3 public tools, semantic discovery pattern)
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions are documented

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each user story includes clear acceptance scenarios
- ✅ User scenarios are prioritized (P1, P2) and independently testable
- ✅ Feature delivers measurable value through defined success criteria
- ✅ Specification maintains focus on "what" and "why" without "how"

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
