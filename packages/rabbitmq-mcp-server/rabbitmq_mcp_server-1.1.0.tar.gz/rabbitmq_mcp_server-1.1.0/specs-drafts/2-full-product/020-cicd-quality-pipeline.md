# SPEC-020: CI/CD and Quality Pipeline

## Overview
Complete continuous integration and deployment pipeline with automated testing, code quality analysis, security scanning, and deployment automation for enterprise-grade software delivery.

## Components

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI**: Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test execution
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Static analysis, linting, and code quality metrics
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability scanning
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated deployment to staging and production

### Quality Gates (Constitution Mandated)
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 95% overall, 80% for critical tools (constitution requirement)
- **Code Quality**: Zero linting warnings and errors
- **Security**: No critical security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Performance regression detection
- **Documentation**: Documentation completeness and accuracy
- **OpenAPI Artifacts**: Verify pre-generated artifacts are up-to-date with OpenAPI specification (DO NOT regenerate in CI/CD)
- **Vector Database**: Verify vector indices are current with OpenAPI specification

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Automated unit test execution
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end integration testing
- **Performance Tests**: Automated performance regression testing
- **Security Tests**: Automated security testing and scanning
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated accessibility compliance testing

### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality analysis and reporting
- **Linting**: Automated code linting and formatting
- **Type Checking**: Type safety validation
- **Code Review**: Automated code review and approval
- **Dependency Management**: Automated dependency updates and security scanning

### Security Pipeline
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Auditing**: Third-party dependency security auditing
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated secret and credential detection
- **Compliance Checking**: Automated compliance validation
- **Security Reporting**: Security status reporting and alerting

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Staging Deployment**: Automated staging environment deployment
- **Production Deployment**: Automated production deployment with approval
- **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback on deployment failure
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment health verification
- **Monitoring Integration**: Deployment monitoring and alerting

### Version Management
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automated version management and tagging
- **Release Notes**: Automated release note generation
- **Changelog Management**: Automated changelog updates
- **Artifact Management**: Automated artifact building and distribution
- **Distribution**: Automated distribution to package repositories

## Dependencies
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Docker for containerized testing
- Security scanning tools
- Code quality analysis tools
- Deployment automation tools

## Implementation Notes
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for pipeline orchestration
- Implement comprehensive quality gates
- Set up automated testing with parallel execution
- **OpenAPI Artifact Validation**: CI/CD verifies generated artifacts are up-to-date (does NOT regenerate)
- **Build Failure Conditions**:
  - OpenAPI specification invalid or cannot be parsed
  - Generated artifacts missing or out-of-sync with OpenAPI
  - Schema validation tests fail
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Validate OpenAPI syntax, verify artifacts are up-to-date, auto-run generation if needed
- Configure security scanning and vulnerability detection
- Implement automated deployment with approval gates
- Set up monitoring and alerting for deployments
- Create rollback procedures and automation
- Implement version management and release automation
- Set up artifact management and distribution
- **LGPL Compliance**: Verify all source files have license headers
- Create pipeline maintenance and update procedures
