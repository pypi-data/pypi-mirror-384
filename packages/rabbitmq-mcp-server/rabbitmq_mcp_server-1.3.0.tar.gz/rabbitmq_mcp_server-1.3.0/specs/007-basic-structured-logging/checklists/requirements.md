# Specification Quality Checklist: Basic Structured Logging

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Review Summary**:
- Specification maintains complete abstraction from implementation details
- All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 5 user stories cover the complete logging lifecycle with clear priorities
- 8 success criteria provide measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- 7 edge cases identified for robust specification
- Scope clearly bounded with comprehensive "Out of Scope" section
- Security requirements (credential redaction) properly emphasized as mandatory
- Performance requirements quantified (5ms overhead, 100MB file size, 30 day retention)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- All checklist items completed successfully
- No specification updates required
- Feature is ready for planning phase
