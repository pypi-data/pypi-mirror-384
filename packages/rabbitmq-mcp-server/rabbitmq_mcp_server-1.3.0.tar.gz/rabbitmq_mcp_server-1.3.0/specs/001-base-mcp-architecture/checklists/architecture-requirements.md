## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Requirements

- [ ] CHK234 - Is the 80% coverage requirement defined per-module, per-feature, or overall? [Ambiguity, Plan §Constitution Check]
- [ ] CHK235 - Are requirements specified for which code is excluded from coverage (e.g., type stubs)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK236 - Are requirements defined for coverage measurement tooling and thresholds? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK237 - Are requirements specified for integration test coverage separately from unit test coverage? [Gap]

### Test Data Requirements

- [ ] CHK238 - Are requirements defined for test RabbitMQ instance configuration? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK239 - Are requirements specified for test data generation (operations, embeddings)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK240 - Are requirements defined for cleaning up test data after runs? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK241 - Are requirements specified for test isolation (parallel test execution)? [Gap]

**Summary**: 241 requirement quality validation items across 12 categories
- Focus: All domains (Semantic Discovery, OpenAPI, AMQP, Observability, Console/i18n, Security)
- Risk Coverage: All identified high-risk areas (thresholds, fallbacks, build/runtime, concurrency, error surfaces)
- Traceability: 127/241 items (53%) include explicit spec/plan/task references; target ≥80% coverage requires adding references to 66+ items
- Depth: Rigorous (release gate level) with emphasis on measurability, edge cases, and cross-document consistency

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and prioritize items by implementation phase
2. Address [Gap] items by adding missing requirements to spec.md
3. Resolve [Ambiguity] and [Conflict] items with clarifications
4. Increase traceability by adding spec section references to remaining items
5. Use as release gate checklist before production deployment
