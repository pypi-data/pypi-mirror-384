# Specification Quality Checklist: Message Publishing and Consumption

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Detailed Assessment

**Content Quality**: 
- ✅ Specification is written in plain language without technical jargon
- ✅ Focus is on user needs (operator scenarios) and business value
- ✅ No framework, language, or API details mentioned
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ No clarification markers present - all requirements are clear and specific
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., "DEVE completar em menos de 100ms")
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (throughput, latency, concurrent users)
- ✅ Success criteria are expressed from user perspective without implementation details
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Eight edge cases identified covering error scenarios and boundaries
- ✅ Scope clearly defined around publish, consume, and acknowledgment operations
- ✅ Key entities documented with their attributes and relationships

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ All 22 functional requirements map to user stories and success criteria
- ✅ User scenarios cover complete flow: publish → consume → acknowledge
- ✅ Ten measurable success criteria defined
- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- No issues or gaps identified during validation
- All user stories are independently testable as MVP slices
- Edge cases provide good coverage of error scenarios and boundary conditions
