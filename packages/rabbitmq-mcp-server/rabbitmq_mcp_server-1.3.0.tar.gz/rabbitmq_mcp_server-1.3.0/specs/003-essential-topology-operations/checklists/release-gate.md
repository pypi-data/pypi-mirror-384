## Summary

**Total Items**: 204  
**Coverage**: Balanced across all quality dimensions  
**Depth**: Deep rigor for formal release gate  
**Focus Areas**: API contracts, safety & error handling, CLI UX, performance & scalability  
**Traceability**: 80%+ items include spec/plan references or gap markers  

**Usage Context**: This checklist validates requirements quality before feature implementation begins. It ensures specifications are complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and ready for development handoff. Use this as a release gate to catch ambiguities, gaps, and inconsistencies that would cause implementation delays or rework.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Work through each category systematically
2. Address identified gaps with spec updates
3. Resolve ambiguities with clarifying requirements
4. Ensure all measurable criteria have objective validation methods
5. Validate traceability from requirements → success criteria → tests
