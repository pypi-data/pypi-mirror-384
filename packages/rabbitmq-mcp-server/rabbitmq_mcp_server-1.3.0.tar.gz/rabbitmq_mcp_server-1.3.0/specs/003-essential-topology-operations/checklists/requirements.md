# Specification Quality Checklist: Essential Topology Operations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids mentioning specific technologies (RabbitMQ Management API mentioned only in assumptions, not in requirements). All requirements are focused on user capabilities and business value.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: 
- All 27 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria includes concrete metrics (2 seconds for lists, 1 second for operations, 100% prevention of unsafe deletions)
- Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios
- 7 edge cases identified covering various failure scenarios
- Assumptions section clearly states dependencies on RabbitMQ Management API and environment conditions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: 
- 3 user stories prioritized (P1: View/Monitor, P2: Create, P3: Delete) with clear reasoning
- Each story independently testable and delivers standalone value
- Success criteria align with functional requirements (performance, safety, error handling)

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All quality checks passed

**Specification Quality**: Excellent
- Clear separation between user needs and implementation
- Well-structured with prioritized user stories
- Comprehensive coverage of functional requirements
- Strong focus on safety and validation
- Measurable success criteria

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning
