# SPEC-005: Basic Console Client

## Overview
Basic command-line interface for interacting with the RabbitMQ MCP server, providing essential operations through a user-friendly CLI.

## Components

### CLI Framework
- **Click Integration**: Command-line interface using Click framework
- **Rich UI**: Enhanced terminal output with Rich library
- **Command Structure**: Organized command groups and subcommands
- **Help System**: Built-in help and documentation

### Core Commands
- **Connection Commands**: Connect, disconnect, health check
- **Topology Commands**: List, create, delete queues and exchanges
- **Message Commands**: Publish, subscribe, acknowledge messages
- **Status Commands**: Show connection status and basic metrics

### User Experience
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time interaction with RabbitMQ
- **Command History**: Persistent command history
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for long operations

### Language Support
- **English**: Primary language support for MVP
- **Localization Ready**: Framework for future multi-language support (20 languages in full product)
- **Constitution Requirement**: Full product MUST support 20 most spoken languages

## Technical Requirements

### Command Structure
```
rabbitmq-mcp
├── connect [options]
├── disconnect
├── health
├── queue
│   ├── list
│   ├── create <name> [options]
│   └── delete <name>
├── exchange
│   ├── list
│   ├── create <name> <type> [options]
│   └── delete <name>

```

### Performance
- Command response time < 100ms for simple operations
- Interactive mode responsiveness
- Efficient command parsing and execution

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for common issues
- Connection error handling
- Validation error reporting
- Graceful failure recovery

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Interactive mode works smoothly
- [ ] Command help system is comprehensive
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Command history is persistent
- [ ] Rich UI enhances user experience

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Command response time under 100ms
- [ ] Interactive mode is responsive
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use

### Usability Requirements

## Dependencies
- click for CLI framework
- rich for enhanced terminal output
- asyncio for concurrent operations
- MCP client for server communication

## Implementation Notes
- Use Click for command-line interface
- Implement Rich for enhanced terminal output
- **Semantic Discovery Support**: CLI must support `search-ids` → `get-id` → `call-id` workflow
- **Direct Commands**: Provide convenient shortcuts for common operations
- Support both interactive and batch modes
- Provide comprehensive help and examples
- Handle MCP client communication errors gracefully
- **Structured Logging**: Log all CLI operations using structlog
- **uvx Support**: README.md must include examples showing `uvx` usage
- **Accessibility**: Support screen readers and keyboard-only navigation (constitution requirement)
