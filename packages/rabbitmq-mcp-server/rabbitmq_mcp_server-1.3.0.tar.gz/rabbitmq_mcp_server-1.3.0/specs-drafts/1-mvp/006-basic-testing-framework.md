# SPEC-006: Basic Testing Framework

## Overview
Essential testing framework to ensure quality and reliability of the MVP with comprehensive test coverage for critical components.

## Components

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with pytest
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real RabbitMQ instances
- **Contract Tests**: MCP protocol compliance validation
- **Performance Tests**: Basic performance and latency testing

### Test Coverage
- **Critical Tools**: 80% minimum coverage for connection management, message operations, queue operations
- **Authentication**: Complete coverage for authentication flows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- **MCP Compliance**: Full protocol compliance verification

### Test Infrastructure
- **Test Environment**: Isolated test environment setup
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: Real RabbitMQ instance for integration tests
- **Mock Services**: Mock services for unit testing
- **Test Data**: Consistent test data and fixtures

### Test Categories
- **Connection Tests**: Connection establishment, failure, recovery
- **Topology Tests**: Queue/exchange creation, deletion, listing
- **Message Tests**: Publishing, consumption, acknowledgment
- **CLI Tests**: Console client functionality and user experience

## Technical Requirements

### Test Framework
- pytest as primary testing framework
- pytest-asyncio for async test support
- pytest-mock for mocking capabilities
- Coverage reporting with pytest-cov

### Integration Testing
- Real RabbitMQ Docker container for integration tests
- Test database isolation
- Cleanup procedures between tests
- Parallel test execution support

### Performance Testing
- Latency measurement for critical operations
- Throughput testing for message operations
- Memory usage monitoring
- Connection pool testing

### Coverage Requirements (Constitution Mandated)
- **Minimum 80% coverage for critical tools** (connection management, message publishing/consuming, queue operations, authentication, error handling)
- **100% coverage for authentication flows**
- **100% coverage for error handling paths**
- **100% coverage for MCP protocol compliance**
- **Contract Tests**: Must validate against OpenAPI specification
- **Test-First Development (TDD)**: Mandatory Red-Green-Refactor cycle

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All unit tests pass consistently
- [ ] Integration tests work with real RabbitMQ
- [ ] Contract tests validate MCP compliance
- [ ] Performance tests meet latency requirements
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum requirements

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 80% coverage for critical tools achieved
- [ ] 100% coverage for authentication flows
- [ ] 100% coverage for error handling
- [ ] All tests run in parallel successfully
- [ ] Test execution time under 5 minutes

### Reliability Requirements
- [ ] Tests are deterministic and repeatable
- [ ] No flaky tests in the suite
- [ ] Proper test isolation and cleanup
- [ ] CI/CD integration ready

## Dependencies
- pytest and pytest plugins
- Docker for RabbitMQ integration tests
- pytest-asyncio for async testing
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting

## Implementation Notes
- **TDD Mandatory**: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Implementation (constitution requirement)
- Use Docker Compose for test environment setup
- Implement proper test fixtures and data
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use real RabbitMQ for integration tests
- **OpenAPI Contract Tests**: Validate MCP tool behavior against OpenAPI specification
- **Schema Validation Tests**: Test pre-generated Pydantic models against OpenAPI schemas
- Implement test data cleanup procedures
- Configure parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- Set up coverage reporting and thresholds (minimum 80% for critical tools)
- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests must pass with 100% success before merge
