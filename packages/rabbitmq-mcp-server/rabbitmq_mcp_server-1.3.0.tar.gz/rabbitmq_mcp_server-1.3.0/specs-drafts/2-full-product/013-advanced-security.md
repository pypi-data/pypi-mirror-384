# SPEC-013: Advanced Security

## Overview
Enterprise-grade security system with multiple authentication methods, TLS encryption, rate limiting, and comprehensive access control for production environments.

## Components

### Authentication Methods
- **Username/Password**: Primary authentication method with secure storage
- **X.509 Client Certificates**: Certificate-based authentication
- **LDAP Integration**: Enterprise directory service integration
- **OAuth/JWT**: Token-based authentication (if supported by RabbitMQ)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional MFA support

### Encryption and Security
- **TLS/SSL**: End-to-end encryption for all connections
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate rotation and validation
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Encrypted storage of authentication credentials
- **Network Security**: VPN and firewall integration support

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system
- **Virtual Host Isolation**: Per-vhost access control and isolation
- **User Management**: Create, update, delete user accounts
- **Permission Management**: Fine-grained permission control

### Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention
- **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits per user
- **Per-Tool Rate Limiting**: Rate limits for specific MCP tools
- **Abuse Detection**: Automated abuse detection and prevention
- **Temporary Blocks**: Automatic temporary blocking of abusive users

### Security Monitoring
- **Authentication Logging**: Comprehensive authentication event logging
- **Security Alerts**: Real-time security event alerts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for all security events
- **Compliance Reporting**: Security compliance reporting and validation

### Internal Operations (Auto-generated from OpenAPI)
**OpenAPI-Driven**: Security operations derived from RabbitMQ Management API.

- `users.list`: GET /api/users - List all users (from OpenAPI)
- `users.get`: GET /api/users/{name} - Get user details (from OpenAPI)
- `users.create`: PUT /api/users/{name} - Create user (from OpenAPI)
- `users.delete`: DELETE /api/users/{name} - Delete user (from OpenAPI)
- `permissions.list`: GET /api/permissions - List permissions (from OpenAPI)
- `permissions.set`: PUT /api/permissions/{vhost}/{user} - Set permissions (from OpenAPI)
- `vhosts.list`: GET /api/vhosts - List virtual hosts (from OpenAPI)
- `vhosts.create`: PUT /api/vhosts/{name} - Create vhost (from OpenAPI)
- `vhosts.delete`: DELETE /api/vhosts/{name} - Delete vhost (from OpenAPI)

**Note**: All operations auto-generated from OpenAPI `paths` with tags "Users", "Permissions", "Virtual Hosts"
