# SPEC-012: Advanced Monitoring and Metrics

## Overview
Comprehensive observability and monitoring system with Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting, and request tracing for enterprise-grade monitoring.

## Components

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus Integration**: Native Prometheus metrics export
- **Custom Metrics**: RabbitMQ-specific metrics and KPIs
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rates
- **Resource Metrics**: Memory, CPU, connection pool health
- **Business Metrics**: Message processing rates, queue depths

### Monitoring Dashboards
- **Grafana Integration**: Pre-built dashboards for RabbitMQ monitoring
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live performance and health monitoring
- **Custom Dashboards**: Configurable dashboards for specific use cases
- **Alert Visualization**: Visual representation of alerts and thresholds

### Alerting System
- **Configurable Alerts**: Customizable alert rules and thresholds
- **Multiple Channels**: Email, Slack, PagerDuty, webhook notifications
- **Alert Escalation**: Multi-level alert escalation policies
- **Alert Suppression**: Smart alert suppression to prevent noise

### Request Tracing
- **MCP Request Correlation**: End-to-end request tracing
- **Message Flow Tracking**: Track messages across queues and consumers
- **Performance Tracing**: Detailed latency breakdown
- **Distributed Tracing**: Support for distributed message processing

### Health Monitoring
- **Service Health**: RabbitMQ service availability and status
- **Connection Health**: Connection pool and broker health
- **Queue Health**: Queue depth, consumer health, processing rates
- **System Health**: Memory usage, CPU, disk space monitoring

### Internal Operations (Auto-generated from OpenAPI)
**OpenAPI-Driven**: Monitoring operations derived from RabbitMQ Management API.

- `queues.get-stats`: GET /api/queues/{vhost}/{name} - Get queue statistics (from OpenAPI)
- `exchanges.get-stats`: GET /api/exchanges/{vhost}/{name} - Get exchange metrics (from OpenAPI)
- `connections.list`: GET /api/connections - Get connection statistics (from OpenAPI)
- `nodes.get`: GET /api/nodes/{name} - Get node health and metrics (from OpenAPI)
- `health.get-overview`: GET /api/overview - Get cluster overview (from OpenAPI)
- `monitor.prometheus-metrics`: Custom Prometheus metrics export (NOT in OpenAPI)

**Note**: Most operations auto-generated from OpenAPI. Custom monitoring wraps these with Prometheus exposition.
