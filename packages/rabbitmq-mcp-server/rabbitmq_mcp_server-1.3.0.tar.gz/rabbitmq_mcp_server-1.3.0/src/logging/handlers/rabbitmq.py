    Handler that publishes log entries to RabbitMQ topic exchange.

    Features:
    - Publishes to topic exchange with routing key {level}.{category}
    - Persistent messages (delivery_mode=2)
    - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
    - Graceful fallback to console if broker unavailable
    - Thread-safe publishing

    Example:
        handler = RabbitMQLogHandler(
            host="localhost",
            port=5672,
            exchange="logs",
