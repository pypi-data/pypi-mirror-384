## DASH (wip)

Implementation of DASH, [Warm-Starting Neural Network Training in Stationary Settings without Loss of Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23495)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install DASH-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from torch.nn import Linear

from DASH.DASH import AdamW

net = Linear(10, 5)
optim = AdamW(net.parameters(), lr = 3e-4)

loss = net(torch.randn(10)).sum()
loss.backward()

optim.step()
optim.zero_grad()

optim.shrink_params()
optim.clear_grad_ema()
```
