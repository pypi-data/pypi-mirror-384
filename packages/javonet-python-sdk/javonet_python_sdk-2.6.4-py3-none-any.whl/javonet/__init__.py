"""
Javonet Python SDK
===================

Javonet Python SDK is a library that allows Python developers to integrate and use modules or packages written in various languages like Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Clojure, C#, VB.NET, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, TypeScript as if they were created in Python.

How to use the documentation
----------------------------
Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided
with the code, and a loose standing reference guide, available from
`the Javonet homepage <https://www.javonet.com>`_.

Getting Started
---------------
To use Javonet Python SDK, you need to have the runtime of the technology you want to call installed on your system. You can download the Javonet Python SDK from the PyPI public repository or from My Javonet Portal. 

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install javonet-python-sdk
```
You also need a license key to activate Javonet. You can get this key from the register or log in page on the Javonet website.

First Sample Application
Here's a simple example of how to use Javonet Python SDK:

In this example, we're using Javonet to access a static field from a .NET Core library. You can use the same approach to access modules or packages from other technologies.

Javonet Python SDK also supports remote operation, allowing you to interact with runtime objects on any remote node, container, or service. This makes it easy to switch between monolithic and microservices architectures without having to implement a separate integration layer.

For more information on how to use Javonet Python SDK, including more detailed use cases and software architecture scenarios, please refer to the official Javonet documentation.
