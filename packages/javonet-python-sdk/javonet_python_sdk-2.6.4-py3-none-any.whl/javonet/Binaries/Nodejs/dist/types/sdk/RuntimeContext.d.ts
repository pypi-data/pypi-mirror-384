 * Multiple Runtime Contexts can be initialized within one process.
 * Calling the same technology on inMemory communication channel will return the existing instance of runtime context.
 * Calling the same technology on TCP channel but on different nodes will result in unique Runtime Contexts.
 * Within the runtime context, any number of libraries can be loaded and any objects from the target technology can be interacted with, as they are aware of each other due to sharing the same memory space and same runtime instance.
