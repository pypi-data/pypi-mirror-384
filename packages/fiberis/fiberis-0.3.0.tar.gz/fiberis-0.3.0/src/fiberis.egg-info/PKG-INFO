# fibeRIS

**fibeRIS: Fiber Optic Reservoir Integrated Simulator**

`fibeRIS` is a Python-based toolkit for the analysis, simulation, and management of data relevant to reservoir engineering, with a particular focus on Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) data. This project provides a suite of modules for handling multi-dimensional datasets, performing signal processing, simulating pressure diffusion, and programmatically controlling the [MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment)](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/) framework.

## Functions of fiberis

### Data management
TBD
### Data cleansing
TBD
### Data processing
TBD
### Simulation
I just can't find a phrase like "data xxx" :(

## Installation

To install `fibeRIS` in editable mode, which is recommended during its ongoing development, clone the repository and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## License

This project is licensed under the WTFPL â€“ Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License. See the `LICENSE` file for details.
