def handle_input(
    user_input, invalid_sequence_action="convert", output_name=None, seq_index_start=1
):
    """
    Dynamically handle the input from the user.
    This returns a dictionary with either the names from
    the user's input file or the users input dictionary of
    sequences or will create a dictionary with the sequences
    numbered in the order they were passed in with seq_index_start
    as the starting index.

    Parameters
    -----------
    user_input: str, list, dict
        This can be one of a few different options:
            str: A .fasta file
            str: A seq.in file formatted as a .tsv with name\tseq
            str: A .tsv file formatted as name\tseq. Same as seq.in
                except a different file extension. Borna used a seq.in
                in his tutorial, so I'm rolling with it.
            str: A sequence as a string
            list: A list of sequences
            dict: A dict of sequences (name: seq)

    invalid_sequence_action: str
        This can be one of 3 options:
            fail - invalid sequence cause parsing to fail and throw an exception
            remove - invalid sequences are removed
            convert - invalid sequences are converted
            Default is 'convert'
            Only these 3 options are allowed because STARLING cannot handle
            non-canonical residues, so we don't want to use the protfasta.read_fasta()
            options that allow this to happen.

    output_name : str
        If provided and if a single amino acid sequence is passed in, this will be the key
        in the output dictionary. If None, the key will be 'sequence_<index>'. If a dictionary
        or list or path to a FASTA file is passed, this is ignored. Default is None.

    seq_index_start: int
        If we need to number sequences in the output dictionary, this is the starting index.
        This is only needed if a sequence as a string is passed in or if a list of sequences
        is passed in.

    Returns
    --------
    dict: A dictionary of sequences (name: seq)
    """

    """
    Main function for generating the distance maps using STARLING. Allows
    you to pass a single sequence, a list of sequences, a dictionary, or
    a path to a .fasta file, a .tsv file, or a seq.in file, and from that
    generate distance maps and 3D conformational ensembles using the
    STARLING model. This function is the main user-facing STARLING function.

    Note: if you want to change the location of the networks,
    you need to change them in the configs.py file. Those paths get
    read in by the ModelManager class and are not passed in as arguments
    to this function. This lets us avoid iteratively loading the network
    when running the generate function multiple times in a single session.

    Parameters
    ---------------
    user_input : str, list, dict
        This can be one of a few different options:
            str: A path to a .fasta file as a str.
            str: A path to a seq.in file formatted as a .tsv with name\tseq
            str: A path to a .tsv file formatted as name\tseq. Same as
                seq.in except a different file extension. Borna used a seq.in
                in his tutorial, so I'm rolling with it.
            str: A sequence as a string
            list: A list of sequences
            dict: A dict of sequences (name: seq)

    conformations : int
        The number of conformations to generate. Default is 200.

    device : str
        The device to use for predictions. Default is None. If None, the
        default device will be used. Default device is 'gpu'.
        This is MPS for apple silicon and CUDA for all other devices.
        If MPS and CUDA are not available, automatically falls back to CPU.

    steps : int
        The number of steps to run the DDPM model. Default is 10.

    ddim : bool
        Whether to use DDIM for sampling. Default is True.

    return_structures : bool
        Whether to return the 3D structure. Default is False.

    batch_size : int
        The batch size to use for sampling. 100 uses ~20 GB
        of memory. Default is 100.

    num_cpus_mds : int
        The number of CPUs to use for MDS. Default is 4

    num_mds_init : int
        Number of independent MDS jobs to execute. Default is
        4. Note if goes up in principle more shots of finding
        a good solution but there is a performance hit unless
        num_cpus_mds == num_mds_init.

    output_directory : str
        The path to save the output.

        If set to None, no output will be saved to disk.

        If not None, will save the output to the specified path.
        This includes the distance maps and, if
        return_structures=True, the 3D structures.

        The distance maps are saved as .npy files with the names
        <sequence_name>_STARLING_DM.npy and the structures are
        saved with the file names <sequence_name>_STARLING.xtc
        and <sequence_name>_STARLING.pdb.

        <sequence_name> here will depend on the input provided
        to generate. If the input is a dictionary, then the keys
        will be used as the sequence names. If the input is a
        list or a single sequence, the sequence will be saved
        as 'sequence_<index>'. If a path to a FASTA file is passed
        in, the headers from the FASTA file will be used. Note also
        if a single sequence is passed the sequence_<index> format
        can be overridden by setting the output_name parameter.

        Default is None.

    output_name : str
        If provided and if a single amino acid sequence is passed in,
        this will be the key in the output dictionary. If None, the
        key will be 'sequence_<index>'. If a dictionary or list or path
        to a FASTA file is passed, this is ignored. Default is None.

    return_data : bool
        If True, will return a dictionary of Ensemble objects which will
        include structural ensembles if return_structures=True. If False,
        will return None (so you need to set the output_dictionary, or the
        analysis will be lost!). Default is True.

    verbose : bool
        Whether to print verbose output. Default is False.

    show_progress_bar : bool
        Whether to show a progress bar. Default is True.

    show_per_step_progress_bar : bool, optional
        Whether to show progress bar per step.
        Default is True
    pdb_trajectory : bool
        Whether to save the trajectory as a pdb file.
        Default is False.

    return_single_ensemble : bool
        If True, will return a single starling.structure.ensemble.Ensemble
        object instead of a dictionary of ensemble objects IF and only if
        there is one sequence passed. If this option is passed and multiple
        sequences are passed this will throw an ValueError. Default False.

    encoder_path : str, optional
        Path to a custom encoder model checkpoint file to use instead of the default.
        This allows using your own pretrained models.
        Default is None, which uses the default model path from configs.py.

    ddpm_path : str, optional
        Path to a custom diffusion model checkpoint file to use instead of the default.
        This allows using your own pretrained models.
        Default is None, which uses the default model path from configs.py.

    Returns
    ---------------
    dict, None, or Ensemble
        The function returns a dictionary of Ensemble objects,
        a single Ensemble object, or a None depending on the
        requested return information.

        The default behavior is to return a dict of Ensemble
        objects, which happens if return_data=True and
        and return_single_ensemble=False.

        If return_data=False then None is returned.

        If return_single_ensemble=True then a single Ensemble
        object is returned.

        if return_data=False and return_single_ensemble=True
        then a ValueError exception is raised.
