- Initial Guide Window Schema [#120]

- Enumerate aperture_name in the aperture schema [#129]

- Remove exptype and p_keywords from Distortion Model [#127]

- Added photom keyword attribute to cal_step schema. [#132]

- Added ma_table_number to observation and dark schemas. [#134]

- Create distortion schema [#122]

0.10.0 (2022-02-22)
-------------------

- Moved detector list to new file for importing to both data and reference schemas. [#119]

- Added support for Distortion reference files. Tweaked schema for WFI detector list. [#122]

- Changed input_unit and output_unit keyword types, titles, and tests. [#126]

- Removed exptype and p_keywords from Distortion schema. [#128]


0.9.0 (2022-02-15)
------------------

- Add FGS (Fine Guidance System) modes to guidestar schema. [#103]

- Set all calsteps to required. [#102]

- Added p_exptype to exposure group for reference files (dark & readnoise)
  to enable automatic rmap generation. Added test to ensure that the p_exptype
  expression matched the exposure/type enum list. [#105]

- Added boolean level0_compressed attribute keyword to exposure group to
  indicate if the level 0 data was compressed. [#104]

- Update schemas for ramp, level 1, and 2 files to contain accurate representation of
  reference pixels. The level 1 file has an array that contains both the science and
  the border reference pixels, and another array containing the amp33 reference pixels.
  Ramp models also have an array that contains the science data and the border reference
  pixels and another array for the amp33 reference pixels, and they also contain four
  separate arrays that contain the original border reference pixels copied during
  the dq_init step (and four additional arrays for their DQ). The level 2 file data
  array only contains the science pixels (the border pixels are trimmed during ramp fit),
  and contains separate arrays for the original border pixels and their dq arrays, and
  the amp33 reference pixels. [#112]

- Added ``uncertainty`` attributes to ``photometry`` and ``pixelareasr``
  to the photometry reference file schema. [#114]

- Removed ``Photometry`` from required properties in ``common``. [#115]
