## What is it?

**nft-market** is a Python library by which current market information of NFTs on several famous NFT markets (OpenSea,
Magic Eden, tofuNFT, PancakeSwap, etc) can be obtained.

## Main features

**nft-market** provides simple APIs that return market information just by your giving the following arguments.

- The marketplace (from `nft_market.Market`)
- the ID of a specific NFT ([See the below in detail](https://github.com/ukaznil/nft-market#how-to-get-the-id-of-a-nft))

```python
from nft_market import Market, Retriever

r = Retriever()
print(r.fetch(Market.OpenSea, 'boredapeyachtclub'))  # Bored Ape Yacht Club

# [Output]
# type: nft_market.NFTInfo
# NFTInfo(id='boredapeyachtclub', name='Bored Ape Yacht Club', num_supply=None, num_listing=10000, num_owners=6400, floor=111.0, volume=487600.0)
```

### Currently supported explorers

If possible, using these explorers is recommended rather than using the above marketplaces, such as Enterpot, for more
stability.

- [ICScan](https://icscan.io/nft) (Supporting: ICP)
- [NFTgeek](https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/) (Supporting: ICP)

### How to get the ID of a NFT?

Although it depends on which marketplace you use, you can basically find it in the URL.

#### Example 1: OpenSea

When you want to retrieve the information of the NFT of [Bored Ape Yacht Club
](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub), the URL looks like `https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub`
. In this URL, what differs according to a NFT is the part of `boredapeyachtclub`, which is all you need to use **
nft-market**.

#### Example 2: tofuNFT

URLs look like `https://tofunft.com/collection/astardegens/items`. In this case, what **nft-market** requires is only
the part of `astardegens`.

#### Other examples

We have several examples of the usage in [samples.py](https://github.com/ukaznil/nft-market/blob/master/samples.py) for
references.

### Available information

## Installation

You can install **nft-market** by pip.

```shell
$ pip install nft-market
```

Also, as **nft-market** depends on Firefox and its driver, you need to install them.

```shell
[mac]
$ brew install firefox

[ubuntu]
$ sudo apt install firefox
```

Besides, all Python dependencies are listed up in `requirements.txt`. Please install them
by `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` if you install **nft-market** not by pip but by cloning from GitHub.

## For developers

You can run tests similarly as GitHub Actions in your local environment by using [ACT](https://github.com/nektos/act).
We highly recommend you try this for at least what you added before push.

### Installation

```shell
# mac
$ brew install act

# Linux
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Windows Chocolatey
$ choco install act-cli

# Windows Scoop
$ scoop install act
```

### How to use act?

Make sure that you're already running Docker Desktop, and then just run act!

```shell
$ act push --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

Note that when you see choices as for the default size of images, you need at least "Medium".

```shell
Default image and other options can be changed manually in ~/.actrc (please refer to https://github.com/nektos/act#configuration for additional information about file structure)  [Use arrows to move, type to filter, ? for more help]
  Large
> Medium
  Micro
```
