# AgenticFleet

## Project Overview

AgenticFleet is a multi-agent orchestration system built on the Microsoft Agent Framework. It uses a manager/executor pattern (`Magentic`) to coordinate specialized agents, including an Orchestrator, Researcher, Coder, and Analyst. The project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the agent fleet, with features like persistent memory (via Mem0), workflow checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) safety approvals.

The project is written in Python and uses `uv` for package management. It is designed to be highly configurable, with settings for workflows, agents, and credentials managed through YAML files and environment variables.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: 3.12+
- **Package Manager**: `uv`
- **AI Framework**: Microsoft Agent Framework (`agent-framework`, `Magentic`)
- **Models**: OpenAI (configurable)
- **Memory**: `Mem0` (optional)
- **CLI**: `rich`, `prompt-toolkit`

## Building and Running

The project uses `uv` for dependency management and running scripts. Key commands are also available as `make` targets.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Qredence/agentic-fleet.git
   cd agentic-fleet
   ```
2. **Configure Environment:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   Alternatively, use the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the interactive CLI:

```bash
fleet
```

or

```bash
uv run fleet
```

or

```bash
make run
```

### Running Tests

To run the full test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

or

```bash
make test
```

## Development Conventions

### Code Style & Linting

The project uses `black` for code formatting and `ruff` for linting.

- **Check for issues:**
  ```bash
  make lint
  ```
- **Format code:**
  ```bash
  make format
  ```

### Type Checking

The project uses `mypy` for static type checking.

- **Run type checker:**
  ```bash
  make type-check
  ```

### All Checks

To run all quality checks (linting, formatting, type-checking) at once:

```bash
make check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to automatically run checks before committing.

- **Install hooks:**
  ```bash
  make pre-commit-install
  ```
