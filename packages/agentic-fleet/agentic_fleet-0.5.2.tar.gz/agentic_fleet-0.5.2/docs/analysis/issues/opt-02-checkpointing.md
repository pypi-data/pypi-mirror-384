## Priority Level

🔥 **High Priority** - Reliability & Cost Optimization

## Overview

Implement workflow checkpointing using Microsoft Agent Framework's built-in checkpoint storage to enable workflow resumption after failures, provide audit trails, and reduce costs by avoiding redundant LLM calls.

## Current State

### Limitations

- No state persistence between workflow runs
- Failed workflows must restart from beginning
- No workflow history or audit trail
- No ability to replay or debug past executions
- Redundant LLM calls waste tokens and money

## Proposed Implementation

```python
from agent_framework import FileCheckpointStorage, InMemoryCheckpointStorage

# File-based checkpointing for production
workflow = (
    WorkflowBuilder()
    .add_agent(orchestrator, "orchestrator")
    .add_agent(researcher, "researcher")
    .add_agent(coder, "coder")
    .add_agent(analyst, "analyst")
    .with_checkpointing(FileCheckpointStorage("./checkpoints"))
    .build()
)

# Resume from checkpoint
result = await workflow.run(
    user_input,
    checkpoint_id="workflow_abc123"  # Resume from this checkpoint
)

# Time-travel debugging
checkpoints = workflow.list_checkpoints()
state = workflow.load_checkpoint("workflow_abc123")
```

## Benefits

- ✅ **Resume Failed Workflows**: Continue from last checkpoint instead of restarting
- ✅ **Cost Savings**: Avoid redundant LLM API calls (can save 50-80% on retry costs)
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all workflow executions
- ✅ **Time-Travel Debugging**: Replay workflows to debug issues
- ✅ **Compliance**: Required for regulated industries
- ✅ **User Experience**: Users don't lose progress on failures

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Checkpointing (Week 1)

- [ ] Add FileCheckpointStorage configuration
- [ ] Enable checkpointing in workflow builder
- [ ] Update CLI to save checkpoint IDs
- [ ] Add checkpoint listing command
- [ ] Test checkpoint save/load

### Phase 2: Resume Support (Week 2)

- [ ] Add --resume flag to CLI
- [ ] Implement checkpoint selection UI
- [ ] Add automatic retry with checkpointing
- [ ] Test failure recovery scenarios

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)

- [ ] Add checkpoint cleanup/pruning
- [ ] Implement checkpoint export/import
- [ ] Add checkpoint visualization
- [ ] Create debugging tools

## Configuration

```yaml
# config/workflow.yaml
workflow:
  max_rounds: 10
  max_stalls: 3
  checkpointing:
    enabled: true
    storage_type: file  # file, memory, redis
    storage_path: ./checkpoints
    cleanup_after_days: 30
    auto_resume_on_failure: true
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

```python
def test_checkpoint_save():
    """Test checkpoint is saved after each step."""
    workflow = create_workflow_with_checkpointing()
    result = await workflow.run("test input")
    checkpoints = workflow.list_checkpoints()
    assert len(checkpoints) > 0

def test_checkpoint_resume():
    """Test workflow resumes from checkpoint."""
    # Run workflow, let it fail midway
    # Resume from checkpoint
    # Verify it continues from saved state
```

### Integration Tests

- Test resume after network failure
- Test resume after agent error
- Test checkpoint cleanup
- Test multiple concurrent workflows

## Estimated Effort

🔨 **Low** (1 week)

The framework provides built-in checkpointing support, so implementation is straightforward.

## Dependencies

- Requires WorkflowBuilder implementation (#OPT-01)
- May require storage backend (file system, Redis)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Workflows save checkpoints automatically
- ✅ Failed workflows can resume from last checkpoint
- ✅ Checkpoint history is accessible
- ✅ No performance impact on normal execution
- ✅ Checkpoints are cleaned up automatically
