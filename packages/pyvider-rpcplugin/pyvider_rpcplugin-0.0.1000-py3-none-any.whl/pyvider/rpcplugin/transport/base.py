"""
Base Abstract Class for RPC Plugin Transports.

This module defines `RPCPluginTransport`, an abstract base class (ABC)
that outlines the contract for all transport implementations within the
Pyvider RPC Plugin system. Concrete transport classes (e.g., for TCP or Unix sockets)
must inherit from this class and implement its abstract methods.

    """
    Abstract base class defining the interface for all transport implementations.

    This class defines the contract that concrete transport implementations
    must fulfill to provide network communication for plugins. The interface
    supports both client-side (connect) and server-side (listen) operations.

    Implementations must handle:
    - Connection setup and teardown
    - Socket lifecycle management
    - Error handling and reporting
    - Resource cleanup

    Custom transports can be implemented by subclassing this class and
    implementing the required abstract methods.

        Start listening for connections.

        Implementations should bind to an appropriate socket or address and
        begin accepting connections. This is typically used by server components.

            The endpoint address as a string (e.g., "127.0.0.1:50051" or
            "/tmp/socket.sock")

        are properly closed and cleaned up. This method should be idempotent.
