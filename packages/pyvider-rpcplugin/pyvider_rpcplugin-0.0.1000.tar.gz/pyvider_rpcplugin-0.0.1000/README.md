## 📖 Full Documentation

For a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and understanding `pyvider.rpcplugin`, including tutorials, advanced topics, and API references, please see the:

➡️ **[User and Developer Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md)**

This guide provides a book-style walkthrough of the framework.

## Overview

`pyvider.rpcplugin` is a Python framework designed to simplify the creation of robust, secure, and high-performance RPC-based plugin systems. It leverages gRPC for efficient communication and integrates with Foundation for:

-   **Async Operations**: Native `asyncio` integration.
-   **Secure Communication**: mTLS with Foundation's certificate management utilities.
-   **Flexible Transports**: Unix Domain Sockets (for local IPC) and TCP sockets (for network IPC).
-   **Standardized Handshake**: Secure plugin authentication using magic cookies and protocol/transport negotiation.
-   **Developer-Friendly Features**: Type safety, factory functions for common patterns, and Foundation's structured logging.

## Quick Installation

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv add pyvider-rpcplugin

# With pip
pip install pyvider-rpcplugin
```
