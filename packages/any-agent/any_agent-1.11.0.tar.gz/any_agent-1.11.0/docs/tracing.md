# Agent Tracing

An [`AgentTrace`][any_agent.tracing.agent_trace.AgentTrace] is returned when calling [`agent.run`][any_agent.AnyAgent.run] or [`agent.run_async`][any_agent.AnyAgent.run_async].

`any-agent` generates standardized (regarding the structure) [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces regardless of the framework used, based on the [Semantic conventions for generative AI systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/). This means that any OpenTelemetry exporter compatible with the Python SDK can be added. More information can be found [below](#adding-an-opentelemetry-exporter).

!!! info

    Check the exposed attributes in [`GenAI`][any_agent.tracing.attributes.GenAI]

You can try to üîç find üîç the subtle differences (regarding the content) across frameworks in the examples below.

!!! tip

    The following are real traces generated by executing [one of our integration tests](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-agent/blob/main/tests/integration/test_load_and_run_agent.py).

## Console

Here is what the console output looks like:

=== "AGNO"

    {% include "../tests/assets/AGNO_trace.html" %}

=== "GOOGLE"

    {% include "../tests/assets/GOOGLE_trace.html" %}

=== "LANGCHAIN"

    {% include "../tests/assets/LANGCHAIN_trace.html" %}

=== "LLAMA_INDEX"

    {% include "../tests/assets/LLAMA_INDEX_trace.html" %}

=== "OPENAI"

    {% include "../tests/assets/OPENAI_trace.html" %}

=== "SMOLAGENTS"

    {% include "../tests/assets/SMOLAGENTS_trace.html" %}

=== "TINYAGENT"

    {% include "../tests/assets/TINYAGENT_trace.html" %}

!!! tip

    The spans are printed to the console by default, using the `callback` mechanism.

    See [Default Callbacks](./agents/callbacks.md#default-callbacks) for more information
    and how to disable this behavior.

## Spans

Here's what the returned [`agent_trace.spans`][any_agent.AgentTrace.spans] look like when [dumped to JSON format](#dumping-to-file):

=== "AGNO"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/AGNO_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

=== "GOOGLE"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/GOOGLE_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

=== "LANGCHAIN"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/LANGCHAIN_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

=== "LLAMA_INDEX"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/LLAMA_INDEX_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

=== "OPENAI"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/OPENAI_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

=== "SMOLAGENTS"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/SMOLAGENTS_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

=== "TINYAGENT"
    ~~~json
    {% include "../tests/assets/TINYAGENT_trace.json" %}
    ~~~

## Dumping to File

The AgentTrace object is a pydantic model and can be saved to disk via standard pydantic practices:

```python
from any_agent import AgentConfig, AnyAgent
from any_agent.tools import search_web

agent = AnyAgent.create(
    "openai",
    agent_config=AgentConfig(
            model_id="mistral/mistral-small-latest",
            tools=[search_web],
    )
)
agent_trace = agent.run("Which agent framework is the best?")
with open("agent_trace.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
  f.write(agent_trace.model_dump_json(indent=2, serialize_as_any=True))
```

!!! tip

    Passing `serialize_as_any=True` makes sure that the `final_output` gets dumped
    even when [`AgentConfig.output_type`][any_agent.AgentConfig.output_type] is used.

## Adding an OpenTelemetry exporter

Before starting to use the library, you can add new OpenTelemetry exporters and processors as needed.

The following code will use the OpenTelemetry Python SDK to send the agent traces to an additional endpoint using OTLP over HTTP in the indicated URL:

!!! tip

    To use custom exporters you need to install their required dependencies,
    In this example, it would be `pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`.

```python
from opentelemetry.trace import get_tracer_provider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

tp = get_tracer_provider()
http_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces")
tp.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(http_exporter))
```
