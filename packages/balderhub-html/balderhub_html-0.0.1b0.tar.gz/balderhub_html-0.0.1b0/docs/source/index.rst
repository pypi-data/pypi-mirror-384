BalderHub-HTML
==============

The BalderHub html package provides basic tests for testing HTML. It also provides a set of features that can be used to
interact with HTML stuff.

.. note::
   Please note, this package is still under development. If you would
   like to contribute, take a look into the `GitHub project <https://github.com/balder-dev/balderhub-html>`_.

This is a BalderHub package for the `Balder <https://docs.balder.dev/>`_ test framework. It allows you to test HTML
stuff, without the need of writing own tests. If you are new to Balder check out the
`official documentation <https://docs.balder.dev>`_ first.
