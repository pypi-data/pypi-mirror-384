"""
This module contains functions and classes to create and manipulate kinematic graphs from Onshape assembly data.

The main class is KinematicGraph, which uses the PathKey-based CAD system to build a directed graph
representing the kinematic structure of a robot assembly. The graph nodes are parts involved in mates,
and edges represent mate relationships.

Classes:
    KinematicGraph: Build and navigate kinematic graph from CAD assembly

Functions:
    plot_graph: Visualize graphs using matplotlib
    get_root_node: Get root node of directed graph
    convert_to_digraph: Convert undirected graph to directed with root detection
    get_topological_order: Calculate topological ordering
    remove_unconnected_subgraphs: Remove disconnected components from graph
