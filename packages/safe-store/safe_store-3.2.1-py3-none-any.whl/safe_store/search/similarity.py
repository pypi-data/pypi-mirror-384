    """
    Calculates cosine similarity between a single query vector and a matrix of vectors.

    Handles normalization and potential zero vectors gracefully.

    Args:
        query_vector: A 1D NumPy array representing the query vector (shape D).
        vectors: A 2D NumPy array where each row is a vector to compare against
                 (shape N, D). Can also handle the case where vectors is 1D
                 (shape D) representing a single comparison vector, by reshaping it.

    Returns:
        A 1D NumPy array of shape (N,) containing the cosine similarity scores,
        where each score is between -1.0 and 1.0.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If inputs are not NumPy arrays.
        ValueError: If input shapes are incompatible (e.g., query is not 1D,
                    matrix is not 1D or 2D, or dimensions mismatch).
