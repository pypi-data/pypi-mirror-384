    Parameters
    --------------
    log
        Event log or Pandas dataframe
    variant
        Variant of the algorithm (available: Variants.BOSE)
    parameters
        Variant-specific parameters

    Returns
    ---------------
    returned_sublogs : List[EventLog]
        A list of sub-logs, where each sub-log is an EventLog object representing the cumulative segment of the original event log from the start up to each detected change point (and the final sub-log up to the end). Note: Due to a potential implementation issue, these sub-logs are not segments between change points but rather cumulative logs up to each change point.
    change_timestamps : List[float]
        A list of timestamps where concept drifts are detected. Each timestamp corresponds to the start time of the first trace in the sub-log where a change point occurs, based on case start timestamps.
    p_values : List[float]
        A list of p-values associated with each detected change point, indicating the statistical significance of the drift (lower values suggest stronger evidence of a change).
