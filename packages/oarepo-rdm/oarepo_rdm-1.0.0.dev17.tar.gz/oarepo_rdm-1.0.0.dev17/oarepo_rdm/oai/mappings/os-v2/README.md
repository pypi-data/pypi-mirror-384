# Percolator index

The oaisource-percolators index is used to store and manage percolator queries for the OAI server. It allows for efficient querying and retrieval of records based on specific criteria defined in the percolator queries.

It is created dynamically during `invenio index init` as it depends on metadata models
of all indexed models. That is why it is empty here.
