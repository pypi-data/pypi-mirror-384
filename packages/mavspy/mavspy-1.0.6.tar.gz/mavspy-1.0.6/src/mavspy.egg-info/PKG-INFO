# MavsPy

Python interface to the [MSU Autonomous Vehicle Simulator](https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/capabilities/mavs.php). 

MAVS is a software library for simulating autonomous ground vehicles in off-road terrain. MAVS simulates the sensors, vehicle, and environment. It uses physics-based models to simulate camera, lidar, and radar interacting with environmental features such as rain, dust, and fog.

Once installed, examples of scripts running different autonomous simulations can be found on the [MAVS-Examples github](https://github.com/CGoodin/MAVS-Examples).
