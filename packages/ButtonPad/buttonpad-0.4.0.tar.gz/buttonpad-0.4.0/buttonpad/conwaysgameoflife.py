"""Conway's Game of Life implemented with ButtonPad.

This version is written in a very beginner-friendly style:
	* The grid is 20 x 20 cells of life. A separate control row of 4 buttons
		(Play/Pause, Clear, Random, Invert) is placed BELOW the grid.
	* Each cell is either OFF (0) or ON (1). The board is stored in a dictionary
		mapping (x, y) -> 0/1. This makes lookups explicit and easy to read.
	* The simulation follows the classic Life rules:
				- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
				- Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
				- All other live cells die; all other dead cells stay dead.
	* We repeatedly "step" the board while the game is in the playing state.
	* Lambdas are used to attach click handlers that know which cell they toggle.

Reading order suggestion for learners:
	1. Constants (grid size & colors)
	2. Small helpers (bounds checks, grid building, setting a cell)
	3. Simulation logic (count_neighbors, step)
	4. Control button handlers (start, pause, clear, random, invert)
	5. main() which wires everything together and starts the GUI loop.
