"""Interactive telephone keypad demo using ButtonPad.

Differences from the simpler `demophonekeypad.py` example:
    * Includes a top "Display" area (a merged text box) that shows the digits
        pressed.
    * Each key updates the display and a status bar message.
    * A delete/backspace key (Unicode erase symbol) removes the last digit.

Beginner notes:
    * ButtonPad builds the interface from a multi-line layout string.
    * Square brackets like [Display] create a merged cell spanning all repeated
        occurrences in that row.
    * We look up cells by (x, y) coordinates starting at (0,0) in the upper-left.
    * Event handler functions always receive (widget, x, y) arguments.
