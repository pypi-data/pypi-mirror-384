"""Animated fish tank demo using ButtonPad.

Description:
    * Creates a grid of water cells with a sand bottom row.
    * Random fish (emojis) swim around the water area, moving one cell at a time
        with randomized delays (each fish has its own speed).
    * One or two bottom creatures (crab/lobster) pace back and forth along the sand.
    * Simple occupancy tracking prevents creatures from overlapping.

Beginner pointers:
    * We store each moving creature as a dictionary with position, speed (ms),
        and direction (for walkers). This keeps code explicit & easy to inspect.
    * Movement is scheduled with Tk's after(): each fish re-schedules its own
        move_fish_one() call when done.
    * The 'occupied' set holds coordinates currently used by any creature to
        avoid overlapping moves.
