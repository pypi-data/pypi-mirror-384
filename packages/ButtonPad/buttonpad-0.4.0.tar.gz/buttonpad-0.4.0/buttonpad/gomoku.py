"""Gomoku game (Five in a Row) implemented with ButtonPad.

Rules (simplified):
    * Two players (White then Black) alternate placing stones on a 15x15 board.
    * First player to get 5 stones in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
    * After a win, the winner is announced and the board resets for a new game.

Implementation notes for beginners:
    * The board is stored as a 2D list of ints: 0 empty, 1 white, 2 black.
    * The GUI grid mirrors this structure; each board cell has a corresponding
        ButtonPad element whose background color we update after each move.
    * To detect a win we count how many same-color stones extend in both
        directions along each of the 4 line orientations passing through the last move.
