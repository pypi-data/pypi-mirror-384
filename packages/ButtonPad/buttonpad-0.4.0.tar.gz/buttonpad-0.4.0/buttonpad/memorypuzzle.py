"""Memory (Concentration) Puzzle using ButtonPad.

Rules / gameplay:
    * A 6 x 4 grid holds 24 face-down cards (12 matching emoji pairs).
    * Click a hidden card to reveal it. Then click a second card:
            - If they match, they stay revealed with a green background.
            - If they don't match, they briefly stay revealed and then flip back.
    * Each pair attempt (whether match or mismatch) increments the 'tries' count.
    * When all pairs are matched, an alert displays the number of tries and a
        new shuffled game automatically starts.

Implementation highlights (beginner friendly):
    * Board data is stored in dictionaries keyed by (x, y) tuples for clarity.
    * 'board' maps coordinates to the emoji on that card.
    * 'revealed' stores which cards are currently face-up temporarily.
    * 'matched' stores which cards are permanently face-up (already matched).
    * A simple 'state' dict tracks the first picked card, whether clicks are
        locked (to prevent double-clicking during flip-back), and the number of tries.
    * We update cell UI via set_cell_ui() so the logic for the look of a cell is
        centralized in one function.
