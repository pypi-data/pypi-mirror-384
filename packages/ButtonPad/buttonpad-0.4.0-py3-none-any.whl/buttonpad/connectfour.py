"""Connect Four implemented with ButtonPad.

Beginner-friendly notes:
    * The visual grid has 7 columns. Row 0 holds the clickable "Drop" buttons.
    * Rows 1..6 display the placed discs (total playable rows = 6).
    * We store the logical board in a dictionary mapping (col, row) -> int:
                0 = empty, 1 = red player, 2 = black player.
    * A move finds the lowest empty row in the chosen column and places a disc.
    * After each move we check for a win (4 in a row horizontally, vertically,
        or on either diagonal) or a tie (board full with no winner).

Read top-to-bottom: constants, state, helpers, gameplay functions, then main().
