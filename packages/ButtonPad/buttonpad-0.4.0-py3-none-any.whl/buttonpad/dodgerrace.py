"""Dodgerace mini-game using ButtonPad.

Goal: Move the blue player square to the green goal square while avoiding
moving red hazards. Each time you reach the goal, your score increases by 1
and the goal teleports to the opposite side. Touching a hazard ends the game
and immediately restarts it (keeping your session high score).

Beginner guide:
    * The board is a 21x21 grid of simple label cells. We redraw only cells that change.
    * Player movement: Arrow keys OR WASD. Movement is clamped to the edges (no wrapping).
    * Hazards: Spawn randomly at edges and drift in a straight line. Each new hazard
        briefly "waits" (STARTING_PAUSE_TICKS) to telegraph before it starts moving.
    * Blocked zone: A solid black 7x7 square in the middle that stops the player
        but not hazards. Hazards pass through it visually.
    * State storage: Everything (player position, hazards, score, etc.) lives in
        a single dictionary called 'state' passed to functions. This keeps globals
        minimal and makes resetting simpler.
    * Timing: Tk's after() schedules the tick() function every TICK_MS ms.
