"""Othello (Reversi) implemented with ButtonPad.

Overview:
    * Standard 8x8 board; players alternate placing discs.
    * A legal move must bracket at least one opponent disc in a straight line
        (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) between the new disc and another disc
        of the moving player; all bracketed discs flip to the moving player's color.
    * If a player has no legal moves, their turn is skipped; if neither side
        can move the game ends and the winner is the player with more discs.
    * After a game ends, we show an alert and reset to the starting position.

Beginner notes:
    * Board is stored as a dict keyed by (x, y) -> int: 0 empty, 1 white, 2 black.
    * We keep 'turn' in a dict so inner handler closure can mutate it.
    * find_flips() returns the list of opponent coordinates that would be
        flipped if a move is placed at (x,y); empty list means move is illegal.
    * The status bar is updated with counts after each successful move.
