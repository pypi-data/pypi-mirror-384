"""Lights Out puzzle implemented with ButtonPad.

Goal: Turn off (darken) all the lights. Clicking a cell toggles that cell and
its four orthogonal neighbors (up/down/left/right). When all lights are off,
the board briefly flashes colors and a new random puzzle appears.

Beginner notes:
    * The puzzle state is a 5x5 list of booleans (True = ON, False = OFF).
    * We redraw all cells after each move (simple and fine for small boards).
    * The flashing win animation uses a scheduled callback (pad.root.after).
    * A factory function builds the click handler so it can capture references
        to both the pad (UI) and the shared state list.
