"""This module defines the `Descriptor` class, which allows assigning tags to parts in the network.

It is designed to manage the mapping between tags, their corresponding data dictionary keys and indices,
and additional properties such as constant or variable status. It provides a way to easily
place constraints on parts of your network, by referencing the tags
instead of indices.

The `Descriptor` class allows for easy constraint definitions on parts of
your neural network. It supports registering tags with associated data dictionary keys,
indices, and optional attributes, such as whether the data is constant or variable.
