This module extends package types Odoo feature in order to better manage stock
moves with packages according to the packaging and stock location properties
(like height, weight or any customized conditions).

Moreover, this module implements "package type put-away strategy" in order to
compute a put-away location using package types.

The standard put-away strategy is applied *before* the package type put-away
strategy as the former relies on product or product category and the latter
relies on stock packages.

In other words, when a move is reserved, Odoo standard put-away strategy will be
applied to compute a new destination on the stock move lines, according to the
product.
After this first "put-away computation", the "package type" put-away strategy
is applied, if the reserved quant is linked to a package defining a package type.

Storage locations linked to the package type are processed sequentially, if
said storage location is a child of the move line's destination location (i.e
either the put-away location or the move's destination location).
For each location, their package type strategy is applied as well as the
restrictions defined on the storage category.
If no suitable location is found, the next location in the sequence will be
searched and so on.

For the package type putaway strategy "None", the location is considered as is.  For
the "ordered children" strategy, children locations are sorted by first by max
height which is a physical constraint to respect, then pack putaway sequence
which allow to favor for example some level or corridor, and finally by name.

At the end, if found location is not the same as the original destination location,
the putaway strategies are applied (e.g.: A "None" pack putaway strategy is set on
computed location and a putaway rule exists on that one).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Currently, the module supports only strategies applied on packages (``stock.quant.package``).
For implementations that do not use packages, it would be possible to add
compatibility with product packaging.

The information needed from a package are:

* the storage type, to know which strategy is applied
* the dimensions and weight, to apply constraints

If we want to support product packaging, we would need to:

* guess the product packaging of a move line based on the product and quantities
  (multiple of a packaging quantity, for instance 8000 would be a pallet if the pallet
  has 2000 units, 1900 would be Box if the Box has 100 units)
* from the product packaging, we know the storage type and dimensions

Everywhere the module is using ``package_id``, we would have to check this:

* use the package if a package is set
* else, use the computed packaging

About Unit of Measures:

In v13, there is an assumption of height to be expressed in mm and weight in kg.
In v14, packaging can be expressed in differents units. Explicit fields are introduced
like max_weight_in_kg in order make simple and efficient computations.


Limitation
==========

If the locations structure is using views intensively in order to separate
storage types kindly (not mixing them), Odoo standard method to get putaway
strategy is returning the first child if a move location destination is a view.

This is not convenient if we want to set specific strategies on that view. So,
we override standard process by returning the view itself (if no putaway is set).

This can lead to a change on standard behavior as people will need to change manually
the location destination for pickings with views as default destination.

Idea: maybe adding a field on view locations to say 'this is a view but don't
apply standard child location selection' could help filtering view candidates.
