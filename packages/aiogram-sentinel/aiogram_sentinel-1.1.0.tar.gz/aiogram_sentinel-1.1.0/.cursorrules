# aiogram-sentinel — Cursor Rules Index

Rules are modularized under `./.cursor/rules/` to stay small, testable, and team-friendly.
See each `.mcp` file for its scope. Follow public API limits and middleware order strictly.

Quick map:
- 00-foundation.mcp — scope, public API, guardrails
- 01-architecture.mcp — layout & boundaries
- 02-style-python.mcp — code style & typing
- 03-style-aiogram.mcp — aiogram v3 middleware/router patterns
- 04-style-storage.mcp — storage & keying
- 05-style-docs.mcp — docs requirements & tone
- 06-style-ci.mcp — CI & tests conventions
- 07-style-security.mcp — security & privacy
