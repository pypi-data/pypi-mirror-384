# SpecStory Extension — Usage & Boundaries

## Purpose
- Capture AI coding conversations to persist rationale and context over time.
- Store artifacts under `.specstory/` (kept in git).

## Boundaries
- Logs are **internal planning**; never copied into library code or docs verbatim.
- Sanitize secrets and PII before saving.
- Prefer short, titled sessions per task/PR.

## Conventions
- File naming: `.specstory/YYYY-MM-DD/<short-topic>.md`
- Include: goal, constraints, links to PR/issues, key decisions, TODOs
- Exclude: tokens, production URLs, user data
