# Shared Context Rules

## Required files
- `.notes/project_overview.md` — elevator pitch, goals, architecture sketch, key tech
- `.notes/task_list.md` — prioritized tasks (High/Med/Low/Done) with owners and notes
- `.notes/directory_structure.md` — generated tree (keep updated)
- `.notes/meeting_notes.md` — short dated bullets of decisions and context

## Editing expectations
- Keep entries concise and current; prefer checklists and bullets
- Update `task_list.md` when opening/merging PRs or changing scope
- Regenerate `directory_structure.md` after significant structure changes
