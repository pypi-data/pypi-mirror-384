# Coding Style â€” Documentation

## Public API
- Every public class/function has a short docstring:
  - purpose in one sentence,
  - parameters & returns (types),
  - async behavior (if relevant).

## README & Docs
- README must show: install, quickstart, middlewares order, hooks, backends, setup helper.
- Keep `docs/` synced with public API.
- Examples must be runnable and **must not** contain secrets.

## Commenting
- Prefer **why** over **what**; remove stale comments during changes.
