# CI & Tests Style

## CI
- GitHub Actions matrix: Python 3.10â€“3.12.
- Redis service for integration tests.
- Steps: install with extras, ruff check, mypy (soft-fail acceptable), pytest.

## Tests
- Unit: memory backends (rate/debounce/blocklist/user repo) + middleware flags/short-circuit.
- Optional: Redis integration guarded by service availability.
- No network or Telegram API calls in tests.
