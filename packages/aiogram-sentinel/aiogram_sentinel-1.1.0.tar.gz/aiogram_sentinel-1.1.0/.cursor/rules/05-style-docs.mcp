# Docs Style

## Must Provide
- README: features, install, quickstart, hooks, middleware order, backends, setup helper.
- docs/: ARCHITECTURE.md, HOOKS.md, SECURITY.md, TESTING.md, ROADMAP.md.
- examples/minimal_bot.py: memory backend; shows resolver/notifier hooks; no secrets.

## Tone & Clarity
- Concise, actionable, runnable snippets.
- Update docs immediately when public API changes.
