# Coding Style â€” Commits & PRs

## Conventional Commits
- Use prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`.
- Imperative mood; concise scope (e.g., `feat(storage): redis rate limiter`).

## PRs
- Small, focused diffs.
- Include: rationale, scope, tests/docs changes.
- Ensure CI green before merge.
- Update README/docs if public API changes; bump semver.

## Tags/Releases
- Tag as `vX.Y.Z` in sync with `version.py`.
