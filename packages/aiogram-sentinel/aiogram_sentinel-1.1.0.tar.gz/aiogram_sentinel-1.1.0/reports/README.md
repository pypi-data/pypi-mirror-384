# Reports Directory

This directory contains various automated reports generated during development and CI/CD processes.

## Structure

```
reports/
â”œâ”€â”€ security/           # Security audit and vulnerability reports
â”œâ”€â”€ coverage/           # Code coverage reports  
â””â”€â”€ performance/        # Benchmark and performance test results
```

## Report Types

### Security Reports (`security/`)

- **pip-audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit Report**: `bandit-report.json` (tracked in git for CI badges)

### Coverage Reports (`coverage/`)

- HTML reports (`htmlcov/`) are ignored by git
- XML reports (`coverage.xml`) are ignored by git
- Coverage data (`.coverage`) is ignored by git

### Performance Reports (`performance/`)
- Benchmark results from `pytest-benchmark`

## Git Tracking Policy

- **Security reports**: âœ… Tracked (needed for CI badges and monitoring)
- **Coverage reports**: ðŸš« Ignored (generated dynamically in CI)

This organization keeps the root directory clean while maintaining accessibility to important reports.
