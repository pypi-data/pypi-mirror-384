# Release Process

This document outlines the release process for aiogram-sentinel, including versioning, automation, and publishing procedures.

## Versioning Scheme & Stability Policy

### Semantic Versioning

aiogram-sentinel follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** (v2.0.0): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** (v1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (v1.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Stability Policy

**v1.x.x (Stable API):**
- No breaking changes in v1.x.x releases
- New features added in minor releases
- Bug fixes in patch releases
- 12-month support for each major version

**v0.x.x (Pre-release):**
- Breaking changes allowed
- Rapid iteration and feedback
- No stability guarantees

### Version Lifecycle

| Version | Status | Support | End of Life |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| v1.0.x | Current | Full | TBD |
| v0.2.x | Deprecated | Security only | v1.1.0 |
| v0.1.x | Deprecated | Security only | v1.0.0 |

## Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The release process is automated using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release to PyPI

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write # IMPORTANT: this permission is needed for trusted publishing

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
        with:
          version: "latest"

      - name: Install build dependencies
        run: |
          uv add --dev hatchling
          uv tool install twine

      - name: Validate version against tag
        run: |
          python tools/check_version_tag.py

      - name: Build package
        run: |
          uv run python -m hatchling build

      - name: Check package
        run: |
          uv tool run --from twine twine check dist/*

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          skip-existing: true
```

### Automated Quality Gates

**Continuous Integration:**
- Code quality checks (linting, type checking)
- Test execution (unit, integration, performance)
- Security scanning
- Documentation validation

**Release Automation:**
- Version validation
- Package building
- PyPI publishing
- GitHub release creation

### Semantic Release (Future)

Planned integration with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated versioning:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/semantic-release.yml
name: Semantic Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Semantic Release
        uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4
        with:
          semantic_version: 19
          extra_plugins: |
            @semantic-release/changelog
            @semantic-release/git
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PYPI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

```

### Package Signing

**Automatic Signing:**
- GitHub Actions signs packages
- GPG key stored in GitHub Secrets
- Signed packages uploaded to PyPI

**Manual Signing:**
```bash
# Sign package
gpg --detach-sign --armor dist/aiogram_sentinel-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Upload signed package
twine upload --sign dist/*
```

### GitHub Releases

**Automatic Release Creation:**
- GitHub Actions creates releases
- Release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- Assets attached (source, wheels)
- Pre-release flag for beta versions

**Manual Release Creation:**
