> Official Python SDK for 1ClickImpact - Easily integrate impact actions into your Python applications

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install makeimpact
# or
poetry add makeimpact
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

You'll need an API key to use this SDK. You can get your API key from the [1ClickImpact Account API Keys page](https://1clickimpact.com/account/api-keys).

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact, Environment

# Initialize the SDK with your API key (production environment by default)
sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Create environmental impact with just a few lines of code
sdk.plant_tree(amount=1)
sdk.clean_ocean(amount=5)
sdk.capture_carbon(amount=2)
```

## üåç Environmental Impact Actions

### üå≥ Plant Trees

Help combat deforestation and climate change by planting trees.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Plant a single tree
sdk.plant_tree(amount=1)

# Plant trees with a specific category
sdk.plant_tree(amount=10, category="food")

# Plant trees with customer tracking
sdk.plant_tree(
    amount=5,
    customer_email="customer@example.com",
    customer_name="John Doe"
)
```

### üåä Clean Ocean Plastic

Remove plastic waste from our oceans to protect marine life.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Clean 5 pounds of ocean plastic
sdk.clean_ocean(amount=5)

# Clean ocean plastic with customer tracking
sdk.clean_ocean(
    amount=10,
    customer_email="customer@example.com",
    customer_name="John Doe"
)
```

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Capture Carbon

Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing carbon.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Capture 2 pounds of carbon
sdk.capture_carbon(amount=2)

# Capture carbon with customer tracking
sdk.capture_carbon(
    amount=5,
    customer_email="customer@example.com",
    customer_name="John Doe"
)
```

### üí∞ Donate Money

Support any cause through direct monetary donations.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Donate $1.00 (amount in cents)
sdk.donate_money(amount=100)

# Donate with customer tracking
sdk.donate_money(
    amount=500,  # $5.00
    customer_email="customer@example.com",
    customer_name="John Doe"
)
```

> **Note**: To set up a custom cause for donations, please contact 1ClickImpact directly.
> All causes must be vetted and approved to ensure they meet their standards for transparency and impact.

## üìä Data Access & Reporting

### Get Records

Retrieve impact records with optional filtering.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Get all records
records = sdk.get_records()

# Filter records by type
tree_records = sdk.get_records(filter_by="tree_planted")

# Filter records by date range
recent_records = sdk.get_records(
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    end_date="2023-12-31"
)

# Pagination
paginated_records = sdk.get_records(
    cursor="cursor_from_previous_response",
    limit=10
)
```

### Get Customer Records

Retrieve records for specific customers.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Get records for a specific customer
customer_records = sdk.get_customer_records(
    customer_email="customer@example.com"
)

# Filter customer records by type
customer_tree_records = sdk.get_customer_records(
    customer_email="customer@example.com",
    filter_by="tree_planted"
)
```

### Get Customers

Retrieve customer information.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Get all customers (default limit is 10)
customers = sdk.get_customers()

# Get customers with filtering and pagination
filtered_customers = sdk.get_customers(
    customer_email="example@email.com",  # Optional: Filter by email
    limit=50,  # Optional: Limit results (1-1000)
    cursor="cursor_from_previous_response"  # Optional: For pagination
)
```

### üîç Track Impact

Track the complete lifecycle and current status of a specific impact, including project location, assigned agents, completion status, and documentation.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# First create an impact
response = sdk.plant_tree(amount=1)

# Then track its progress
tracking_info = sdk.track(
    user_id=response.user_id,
    time_utc=response.time_utc
)

print(f"Tracking ID: {tracking_info.tracking_id}")
print(f"Impact Initiated: {tracking_info.impact_initiated}")
if tracking_info.project_location:
    print(f"Project Location: {tracking_info.project_location}")
if tracking_info.assigned_agent:
    print(f"Assigned Agent: {tracking_info.assigned_agent}")
if tracking_info.impact_completed:
    print(f"Impact Completed: {tracking_info.impact_completed}")
```

You can also track impacts from historical records:

```python
# Get records and track a specific impact
records = sdk.get_records(limit=1)
if records.user_records:
    record = records.user_records[0]
    tracking_info = sdk.track(
        user_id=record.user_id,
        time_utc=record.time_utc
    )
    print("Tracking Info:", tracking_info)
```

**Track Response Fields:**

- `tracking_id`: Unique identifier for this impact (format: `user_id-time_utc`)
- `impact_initiated`: UTC timestamp when the impact was created
- `tree_planted`, `waste_removed`, `carbon_captured`, `money_donated`: Impact metrics (optional)
- `category`: Impact category (e.g., "food" for food-bearing trees)
- `donation_available`: When the donation became available for the project
- `donation_sent`: When the donation was sent to the non-profit
- `assigned_agent`: Name of the agent or organization executing the impact
- `project_location`: Detailed description of project location and partners
- `location_map`: Google Maps embed URL for the project location
- `impact_completed`: When the impact was completed
- `donation_category`: Type of impact funded (for donations)
- `impact_video`: URL to video recording or live session
- `live_session_date`: Scheduled live session timestamp
- `is_test_transaction`: Whether this was a test transaction
- `is_bonus_impact`: Whether this was a bonus impact from subscription plans

### Get Impact

Get aggregated impact statistics.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Get overall impact statistics for your organization
impact = sdk.get_impact()

print(f"Trees planted: {impact.tree_planted}")
print(f"Ocean waste removed: {impact.waste_removed} lbs")
print(f"Carbon captured: {impact.carbon_captured} lbs")
print(f"Money donated: ${impact.money_donated / 100}")
```

### Who Am I

Verify your API key and get account information.

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact

sdk = OneClickImpact("your_api_key")

# Verify API key and get account information
account_info = sdk.who_am_i()
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environments

The SDK supports two environments:

- **Production** (default): Uses the live API at `https://api.1clickimpact.com`
- **Sandbox**: Uses the testing API at `https://sandbox.1clickimpact.com`

To use the sandbox environment for testing:

```python
from makeimpact import OneClickImpact, Environment

# Initialize with sandbox environment
sdk = OneClickImpact("your_test_api_key", Environment.SANDBOX)
```
