# Welcome to MetricFlow

See our latest updates in the [Metricflow Changelog](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)!

MetricFlow is a semantic layer that simplifies defining and managing metrics. It compiles these metric definitions into clear, reusable SQL, ensuring consistent and accurate results when analyzing data by relevant attributes (dimensions).

The name “MetricFlow” reflects its approach: metric requests are compiled into a dataflow-based query plan, which is then optimized and translated into engine-specific SQL.

<br /><br />
</p>

MetricFlow provides a set of abstractions that help you construct complicated logic and dynamically generate queries to handle:

- Multi-hop joins between fact and dimension sources
- Complex metric types such as ratio, expression, and cumulative
- Metric aggregation to different time granularities
- And so much more

To get up and running with your own metrics, you should rely on [MetricFlow’s documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/build-metrics-intro).

## Licensing

MetricFlow is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. For details, please refer to our [licensing agreement](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Open Semantic Interchange (OSI) Initiative

MetricFlow is developed and maintained as part of the [Open Semantic Interchange (OSI) initiative](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/open-semantic-interchange-ai-standard/). The OSI initiative is a collaborative effort among leading technology companies and data practitioners to establish a open standard for defining and exchanging semantic information, enabling AI/BI interoperability across different platforms and tools. 

## Getting Started

### Install MetricFlow

MetricFlow can be installed from PyPi for use as a Python library with the following command:

```
pip install dbt-metricflow
```

MetricFlow currently serves as a query compilation and SQL rendering library, built to work in conjunction with a dbt project. As such, using MetricFlow requires a working dbt project and a dbt adapter. We provide the `dbt-metricflow` bundle for this purpose. You may choose to install other adapters as optional extras from dbt-metricflow.

You may need to install Postgres or Graphviz. You can do so by following the install instructions for [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/). Mac users may prefer to use brew: `brew install postgresql` or `brew install graphviz`.

### Tutorial

The best way to get started is to follow the tutorial steps, which you can access by running:

```
mf tutorial
```

Note: this must be run from a dbt project root directory.
