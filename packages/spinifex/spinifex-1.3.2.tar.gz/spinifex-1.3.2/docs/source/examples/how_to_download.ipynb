    "In `spinifex` we provide an interface for obtaining ionospheric model data from online sources that host IONEX files. Most users won't need to interact with these interfaces directly, as they will be called 'under the hood' by higher-level functions such as `spinifex.get_rm.get_rm_from_skycoord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-IONEX models\n",
    "\n",
    "We note here that `spinifex` also supports models of the ionosphere that do not actually require IONEX files. For example, you can swap the `iono_model` value to one of the other supported models, such as the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). The available models can be enumerated as follows (we typically default to `spinifex.ionospheric.ionospheric_models.ionex`):"

    "#### CDDIS\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDDIS has a large archive of IONEX data back to the 90's, but now requires authentication to access their data. To use this service you must register a NASA EARTHDATA Account [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/). Then you need to create a `~/.netrc` file with the following text\n",
