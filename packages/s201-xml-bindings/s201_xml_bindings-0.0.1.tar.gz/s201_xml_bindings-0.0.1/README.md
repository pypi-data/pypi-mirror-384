# The Python S-201 XML Bindings Package

This Python package provides language bindings for the IALA S-201 data product, 
making it easier for developers to work with S-100 datasets. These bindings
allow developers to programmatically interact with S-100-compliant datasets
and data models, supporting the creation of applications that need to process,
validate, and manipulate S-201 data.

The S-201 belongs to the S-100 framework family, a standard developed by the
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), is the framework for electronic
navigational charts, hydrographic data, and other maritime-related geospatial
information. These bindings are designed to facilitate integration of S-100
data into modern applications without the complexity of directly handling
S-100 specifications.
