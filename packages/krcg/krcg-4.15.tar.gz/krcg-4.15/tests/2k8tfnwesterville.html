Matt's comments on the final:

It didn't work the way it was intended to in the finals. In retrospect
I should have brought out Demdemeh instead of Wamukota as my second
vampire, but I thought his ability would be important for my retain
actions(it was never used). I never could get enough pool to bring
out Demdemeh afterwards. A herd of elephants would have greatly
increased my ousting ability.

It is nice to know that the deck can survive without all of the "A"
team in play.
