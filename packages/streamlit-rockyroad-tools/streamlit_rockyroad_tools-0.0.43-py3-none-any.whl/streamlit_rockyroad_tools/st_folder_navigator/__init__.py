# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a

# `declare_component` and call it done. The wrapper allows us to customize
# our component's API: we can pre-process its input args, post-process its
# output value, and add a docstring for users.

    A streamlit component that displays a folder navigator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folders: list(tuple(str, str)) or list(str)
        A list of tuples where the first element is the folder name and the second element is an identifier.
        Alternatively, a list of strings where each string is a folder name.
    key: str
        A key that uniquely identifies this component.
    on_change: callable, optional
        A callback function that is called when the folder navigator is changed.
    *args, **kwargs: optional
        Additional arguments and keyword arguments to pass to the callback function.

    Returns
    -------
    str or None
        Returns the folder name (if a list of strings is provided) or the identifier (if a list of tuples is provided) of the selected folder when the folder name is clicked,
        otherwise returns None.
