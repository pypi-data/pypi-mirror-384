           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

![TinySemVer Banner](https://github.com/ashvardanian/ashvardanian/blob/master/repositories/TinySemVer.jpg)

__TinySemVer__ is a minimalistic [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) package for projects following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in a single short Python file.
In plain English, if your commit messages look like `feat: add new feature` or `fix: bugfix`, this package will automate releasing new "GIT tags" based on the commit messages.
Here is how to integrate it into your project CI:

```sh
$ pip install tinysemver
$ tinysemver --dry-run --verbose
> Current version: 1.2.2
> Next version: 1.3.0
```

The `--dry-run` flag will only print the next version without changing any files.
Great for pre-release CI pipelines.

## Usage Details for the Command Line Interface

If you need more control over the default specification, here are more options you can run against the files in this repository:

```sh
# This won't push
$ tinysemver --verbose \
    --major-verbs 'breaking,break,major' \
    --minor-verbs 'feature,minor,add,new' \
    --patch-verbs 'fix,patch,bug,improve,docs,make' \
    --changelog-file 'CHANGELOG.md' \
    --version-file 'VERSION' \
    --update-version-in 'pyproject.toml' '^version = "(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"' \
    --github-repository 'ashvardanian/tinysemver'
# Revert to the previous commit
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1                         
```

It's recommended to use strict version matching with `\d+\.\d+\.\d+` instead of a generic wildcard like `.*`, but both would work.
Here is an example of passing even more parameters for a project like `stringzilla`:

```sh
$ tinysemver --verbose \
    --major-verbs 'breaking,break,major' \
    --minor-verbs 'feature,minor,add,new' \
    --patch-verbs 'fix,patch,bug,improve,docs,make' \
    --changelog-file 'CHANGELOG.md' \
    --version-file 'VERSION' \
    --update-version-in 'pyproject.toml' '^version = "(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"' \
    --update-version-in 'package.json' '"version": "(.*)"' \
    --update-version-in 'CITATION.cff' '^version: (.*)' \
    --update-major-version-in 'include/stringzilla/stringzilla.h' '^#define STRINGZILLA_VERSION_MAJOR (.*)' \
    --update-minor-version-in 'include/stringzilla/stringzilla.h' '^#define STRINGZILLA_VERSION_MINOR (.*)' \
    --update-patch-version-in 'include/stringzilla/stringzilla.h' '^#define STRINGZILLA_VERSION_PATCH (.*)' \
    --github-repository 'ashvardanian/stringzilla' \
    --push
> Current version: 1.2.2
> ? Commits since last tag: 3                   # Only in verbose mode
> # 5579972: Improve: Log file patches          # Only in verbose mode
> # de645ea: Improve: Grouping CHANGELOG        # Only in verbose mode

> Will update file: package.json:5
> - "version": "1.2.2"                          # Only in verbose mode
> + "version": "1.3.0"                          # Only in verbose mode
> Will update file: pyproject.toml:7
> - version = "1.2.2"                           # Only in verbose mode
> + version = "1.3.0"                           # Only in verbose mode
> Will update file: CITATION.cff:7
> - version: 1.2.2                              # Only in verbose mode
> + version: 1.3.0                              # Only in verbose mode
> Appending to changelog file: CHANGELOG.md
> = skipping 250 lines                          # Only in verbose mode
> + adding 30 lines                             # Only in verbose mode
```

Alternatively, you can just ask for `--help`:

```sh
$ tinysemver --help
```

## Usage Details for the GitHub CI Action

TinySemVer can be easily integrated into your GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
Assuming the differences between YAML and shell notation, some arguments are passed in a different form, like `--update-version-in`.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  semver:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v5
      with:
        persist-credentials: false # Only if main branch if protected

    - name: Run TinySemVer
      uses: ashvardanian/tinysemver@v3 # Automatically receives non-breaking updates
      with:
        major-verbs: 'breaking,break,major'
        minor-verbs: 'feature,minor,add,new'
        patch-verbs: 'fix,patch,bug,improve,docs,make'
        changelog-file: 'CHANGELOG.md'
        version-file: 'VERSION'
        update-version-in: 'pyproject.toml:version = "(.*)"' # Use colon instead of space
        git-user-name: 'GitHub Actions'
        git-user-email: 'actions@github.com'
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        verbose: 'true'
        push: 'true'
        create-release: 'true'
        dry-run: 'false'

  publish:
    needs: semver # Depends on the previous job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          ref: main # Take the most recent updated version
```

Every team has a different workflow, but a common pattern is to have one `release.yml` for the `main` branch and another `prerelease.yml` for the `main-dev` branch used as a staging area.
The latter would run with `dry-run: 'true'` and `push: 'false'` to prevent pushing changes to the main repository.
The `create-release` flag is optional and can be set to `false` if you don't want to create a new release on GitHub.
If you need to update the version in multiple files, pass a multiline string with the `|` operator:

```yaml
        update-version-in: |
          pyproject.toml:version = "(.*)"
          package.json:"version": "(.*)"
          CITATION.cff:version: "(.*)"
```

For examples, consider checking StringZilla, USearch, and other libraries using TinySemVer.

Since version 3.0.0, TinySemVer can optionally maintain moving version tags similar to `actions/checkout@v4`:

```yaml
uses: ashvardanian/tinysemver@v3       # Automatically gets non-breaking updates
uses: ashvardanian/tinysemver@v3.0     # Automatically gets patch updates
uses: ashvardanian/tinysemver@v3.0.0   # Pinned, never changes
uses: ashvardanian/tinysemver@main     # Bleeding edge
```

This feature is disabled by default because it requires force-push permissions.
To enable it, add `push-moving-tags: 'true'` and ensure your token has force-push access:

```yaml
    - name: Run TinySemVer
      uses: ashvardanian/tinysemver@v3
      with:
        push: 'true'
        push-moving-tags: 'true'
        github-token: ${{ secrets.TINYSEMVER_TOKEN }}
```

When enabled, TinySemVer creates three tags: `v3` (major), `v3.0` (minor), and `v3.0.0` (specific).
The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` typically lacks force-push permissions for protected branches.

### Security Considerations

If your default branch is protected with a "pull request before merging" rule:

1. A repository-scoped Personal Access Token (PAT) is required to push to the branch.
2. Set `persist-credentials: false` in the `actions/checkout` step.

Also keep in mind:

- The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be used with protected branches.
- Using a PAT instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN` poses security risks:
  - Workflows from any branch can access secret variables.
  - This could allow non-protected branches to use elevated permissions.
- Mitigation:
  - Use a fine-grained PAT with minimal necessary permissions.
  - Prefer the `pull_request` workflow trigger, which limits permissions.
  - Be cautious: users with write access could still potentially exploit workflows to expose the PAT.

> [!TIP]
> Always follow the principle of least privilege when setting up tokens and permissions.

## Why Create Another SemVer Tool?

In the past I was using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for my 10+ projects.
At some point, a breaking change in the dependencies broke all my projects CI pipelines for a month, affecting dozens of tech companies using those libraries.
I felt miserable trying to trace the issue and reluctant to go through __363K lines of low-quality JavaScript code__ to find the bug.
Yes, it's 363K lines of code:

```sh
$ .../node_modules$ cloc .
   10751 text files.
    7809 unique files.                                          
    3498 files ignored.

Here is the `cloc` output for `tinysemver`:

```sh
$ tinysemver$ cloc .

## What's Missing?

- Optional commit scopes, like `feat(scope): add new feature`. Doesn't make sense for most projects.
- Pre-release versions, like `1.2.3-alpha.1`. Not needed for most projects.
- GenAI.

> For reference, according to SemVer 2.0, all [following versions](https://regex101.com/r/Ly7O1x/3/) are valid: `1.1.2-prerelease+meta`, `1.1.2+meta`, `1.1.2+meta-valid`, `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta`, `1.0.0-alpha.beta.1`, `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `1.0.0-alpha0.valid`, `1.0.0-alpha.0valid`, `1.0.0-alpha-a.b-c-somethinglong+build.1-aef.1-its-okay`, `1.0.0-rc.1+build.1`, `2.0.0-rc.1+build.123`, `1.2.3-beta`, `10.2.3-DEV-SNAPSHOT`, `1.2.3-SNAPSHOT-123`, `2.0.0+build.1848`, `2.0.1-alpha.1227`, `1.0.0-alpha+beta`, `1.2.3----RC-SNAPSHOT.12.9.1--.12+788`, `1.2.3----R-S.12.9.1--.12+meta`, `1.2.3----RC-SNAPSHOT.12.9.1--.12`, `1.0.0+0.build.1-rc.10000aaa-kk-0.1`, `1.0.0-0A.is.legal`.

## Examples

Assembling RegEx queries can be hard.
Luckily, there aren't too many files to update in most projects.
Below is an example of a pipeline for the [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch) project, that has bindings to 10 programming languages.
Feel free to add other sources and examples.

```sh
$ mkdir -p example

## Contributing

Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
If you need to bump the version of `tinysemver` itself:

```sh
tinysemver --verbose \
    --version-file 'VERSION' \
    --changelog-file 'CHANGELOG.md' \
    --update-version-in 'pyproject.toml' 'version = "(.*)"' \
    --github-repository 'ashvardanian/tinysemver' --push
```
