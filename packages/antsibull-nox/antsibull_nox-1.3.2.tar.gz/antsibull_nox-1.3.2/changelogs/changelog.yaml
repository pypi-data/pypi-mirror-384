      - 0.0.1.yml
    release_date: '2025-03-16'
  0.1.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The nox workflow now by default runs all sessions, unless restricted with
          the ``sessions`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure that black in CI checks formatting instead of just reformatting
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
      minor_changes:
        - A ``build-import-check`` session that builds and tries to import the collection
          with Galaxy Importer can be added with ``add_build_import_check()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/15,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/17).
        - A ``docs-check`` session that runs ``antsibull-docs lint-collection-docs``
          can be added with ``add_docs_check()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/8,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
        - A ``extra-checks`` session that runs extra checks such as ``no-unwanted-files``
          or ``action-groups`` can be added with ``add_extra_checks()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/8,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
        - A ``license-check`` session that runs ``reuse`` and checks for bad licenses
          can be added with ``add_license_check()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/8,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
        - Allow to decide which sessions should be marked as default and which not
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/18, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/20).
        - Allow to provide ``extra_code_files`` to ``add_lint_sessions()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/14).
        - Check whether we're running in CI using the generic ``$CI`` enviornment
          variable instead of ``$GITHUB_ACTIONS``. ``$CI`` is set to ``true`` on Github
          Actions, Gitlab CI, and other CI systems (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/28).
        - For running pylint and mypy, copy the collection and dependent collections
          into a new tree. This allows the collection repository to be checked out
          outside an approriate tree structure, and it also allows the dependent collections
          to live in another tree structure, as long as ``ansible-galaxy collection
          list`` can find them (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/1).
        - When a collection checkout is not part of an ``ansible_collections`` tree,
          look for collections in adjacent directories of the form ``<namespace>.<name>``
          that match the containing collection's FQCN (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/6,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/22).
        - antsibull-nox now depends on antsibull-fileutils >= 1.2.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/1).
      release_summary: Feature release.

    release_date: '2025-03-30'
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - All functions in ``antsibull_nox.**`` are deprecated except ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()``,
          ``antsibull_nox.add_ansible_test_session()``, and ``antsibull_nox.sessions.prepare_collections()``.
          The other function will still work for the next minor release, but will
          then be removed. Use ``antsibull-nox.toml`` and ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()``
          instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50).
      major_changes:
        - There is now a new function ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()``
          which loads ``antsibull-nox.toml`` and creates configuration and sessions
          from it. Calling other functionality from ``antsibull_nox`` in ``noxfile.py``
          is only necessary for creating own specialized sessions, or ansible-test
          sessions that cannot be created with the ``antsibull_nox.add_all_ansible_test_*_test_sessions*()``
          type functions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/34).
      minor_changes:
        - Add descriptions to generated sessions that are shown when running ``nox
          --list`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/31).
        - Add function ``add_matrix_generator`` which allows to generate matrixes
          for CI systems for ansible-test runs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32).
        - Add several new functions to add ansible-test runs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/5,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/41,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/45).
        - Add shared workflow for running ansible-test from nox and generating the
          CI matrix from nox as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/35,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/37, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/38,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/48, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/53).
        - Allow to add ``yamllint`` session to ``lint`` meta-session that checks YAML
          files, and YAML content embedded in plugins and sidecar docs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/42).
        - Allow to add ansible-lint session (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/40,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/49).
        - Allow to disable using installed collections that are not checked out next
          to the current one by setting the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_NOX_IGNORE_INSTALLED_COLLECTIONS``
          to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/51).
        - Collapse Galaxy importer's output in GitHub Actions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/46).
        - In the GitHub Action, no longer use installed collections, but only ones
          that have been checked out next to the current one. This avoids using collections
          that come with the Ansible community package installed in the default GHA
          image (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/51).
        - The action allows to install additional Python versions with the new ``extra-python-versions``
          option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32).
        - The action allows to pass extra commands after ``--`` with the new ``extra-args``
          option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/32).
        - antsibull-nox now automatically installs missing collections. It uses ``.nox/.cache``
          to store the collection artifacts and the extracted collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/46,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/52, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/7).
        - pydantic is now a required Python dependency of antsibull-nox (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50).
        - tomli is now a required Python dependency of antsibull-nox for Python versions
          3.9 and 3.10 For Python 3.11+, the standard library tomllib will be used
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/50).

        next minor release is expected to bring more stabilization.

  0.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Action groups extra test no longer fails if ``action_groups`` does not exist
          in ``meta/runtime.yml``. It can now be used to ensure that there is no action
          group present in ``meta/runtime.yml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/60).
        - Do not fail when trying to install an empty list of packages when ``run_reuse=false``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/65).
        - Make sure that ``extra_code_files`` is considered for ``black`` when ``run_black_modules=false``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/59).
        - Make sure to flush stdout after calling ``print()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/67).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``antsibull-nox init`` command that creates a ``noxfile.py`` and ``antsibull-nox.tomll``
          to get started (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/58).
        - Add ``callback_before`` and ``callback_after`` parameters to ``antsibull_nox.add_ansible_test_session()``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/63).
        - Add a ``antsibull-nox`` CLI tool with a subcommand ``lint-config`` that
          lints ``noxfile.py`` and the ``antsibull-nox.toml`` config file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/56).
        - Add a session for linting the antsibull-nox configuration to ``lint`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/56).
        - Add new options ``skip_tests``, ``allow_disabled``, and ``enable_optional_errors``
          for ansible-test sanity sessions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/61).
        - Allow to disable coverage upload for specific integration test jobs in shared
          workflow with ``has-coverage=false`` in extra data (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/64).
        - Ensure that Galaxy importer's output is actually collapsed on GHA (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/67).
        - Never show Galaxy importer output unless it can be collapsed, verbosity
          is enabled, or a new config option ``galaxy_importer_always_show_logs``
          is set to ``true`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/67).
        - Skip symlinks that do not point to files in ``license-check`` and ``yamllint``
          sessions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/61).
        - Update shared workflow to use a ``display-name`` and ``gha-container`` extra
          data (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/63).
      release_summary: 'Feature release that is stabilizing the API.


        All noxfiles and configs using this version should still work with antsibull-nox
        1.0.0,

        unless a critical problem is found that cannot be solved in any other way.'
      removed_features:
        - Removed all deprecated functions from ``antsibull_nox.**`` that generate
          sessions. The only functions left that are public API are ``antsibull_nox.load_antsibull_nox_toml()``,
          ``antsibull_nox.add_ansible_test_session()``, and ``antsibull_nox.sessions.prepare_collections()``

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Adjust yamllint test to no longer use the user's global config, but only
          the project's config (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/72).
      major_changes:
        - Required collections can now be installed from different sources per depending
          on the ansible-core version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/76).
      minor_changes:
        - Capture mypy and pylint errors to report paths of files relative to collection's
          root, instead of relative to the virtual ``ansible_collections`` directory
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/75).
        - Make yamllint plugin check also check doc fragments (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/73).
        - Positional arguments passed to nox are now forwarded to ``ansible-lint``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/74).
        - 'The yamllint session now ignores ``RETURN`` documentation with values ``#``
          and `` # `` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/71).'
        - The yamllint test no longer shows all filenames in the command line (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/72).

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix action group test. No errors were reported due to a bug in the test
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/80).
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to pass environment variables as Ansible variables for integration
          tests with the new ``ansible_vars_from_env_vars`` option for ``sessions.ansible_test_integration_w_default_container``

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Do not fail if an unexpected action group is found that only contains a
          metadata entry (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/81).
        - Fix config file types for ``no_unwanted_files_skip_directories`` and ``no_unwanted_files_yaml_directories``
          to what is documented; that is, do not allow ``None`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/85).
        - Ignore metadata entries in action groups (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/81).
        - The ``no_unwanted_files_skip_directories`` option for the ``no-unwanted-files``

          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/82).
        - The ``yamllint`` test now also checks YAML and YAML+Jinja code blocks in
          extra documentation (``.rst`` files in ``docs/docsite/rst/``) (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/87).

      minor_changes:
        - Antsibull-nox's ansible-core ``devel`` and ``milestone`` branch versions
          have been updated to 2.20. This means that ``stable-2.19`` will now be added
          to CI matrices if ``max_version`` has not been explicitly specified (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/91).
        - The ``docs-check`` session now also passes the new ``--check-extra-docs-refs``
          parameter to ``antsibull-docs lint-collection-docs`` for antsibull-docs
          >= 2.18.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/90).

  1.0.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - New extra check ``avoid-characters`` allows to flag characters / regular
          expressions. This can for example be used to avoid tabulator characters,
          but also more complex character sequences (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/89,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/94).

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:

          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/101).
        - Allow to set preference for container engines with ``ANTSIBULL_NOX_CONTAINER_ENGINE``
          environment variable (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/98,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/100).
        - The YAML-in-RST checker for the ``yamllint`` session now also checks ``ansible-output-data``
          and ``ansible-output-meta`` directives for antsibull-doc's ``ansible-output``
          subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/95,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/96).
        - When using the reusable GHA workflow, execution environment tests are automatically
          added to the matrix (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/16,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/99).
        - antsibull-nox now depends on antsibull-fileutils >= 1.4.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/97).

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - In ``[sessions.lint]``, shell splitting of strings in ``pylint_extra_deps``
          and ``mypy_extra_deps`` is deprecated and will stop working in future releases.
          Use package type dictionaries instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/133).
        - In ``[sessions.lint]``, using strings that start with dashes (``-``) is
          deprecated and will stop working in future releases. Use appropriate package
          type dictionaries instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/133).
        - In all ``_package`` options, package names starting with dashes (``-``)
          are deprecated and will stop working in future releases. Use appropriate
          package type dictionaries instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/133).
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to add tags to integration test sessions, automatically add tags to
          all sessions showing up in the matrix, and allow filtering the CI matrix
          generated by the shared workflow by these tags (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/125,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/125, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/126).
        - Allow to specify Ansible variables in integration tests directly or through
          environment variables with new ``ansible_vars`` config directive (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/117).
        - Allow to specify a list of packages, requirement files, and constraint files
          for every ``_package`` key in the config (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/108,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/119).
        - Allow to specify individual ansible-test integration sessions with the new
          ``[sessions.ansible_test_integration]`` config setting (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/114,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/118).
        - Allow to specify minimum/maximum ansible-core version to ``matrix-generator``
          session and shared workflow (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/113,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/115, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/126).
        - "Antsibull-nox now supports VCS configuration and basic change detection.\n\
          At the moment, the following tests support change detection:\n\n* All ansible-test\
          \ tests configured through ``antsibull-nox.toml``;\n* All ansible-test tests\
          \ configured through ``noxfile.py`` that explicitly allow change detection;\n\
          * All ``lint`` sessions (``formatters``, ``codeqa``, ``yamllint``, ``typing``);\n\
          * The ``extra-checks`` session and all its tests;\n* All tests but ``reuse``\
          \ from the ``license-check`` session;\n* The `docs-check` sessions are restricted\
          \ to changed files (for code-block tests),\n  or skipped if there are no\
          \ appropriate changed files.\n\nChange detection can be enabled with the\
          \ environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_CHANGE_DETECTION``.\nThe base branch\
          \ can explicitly set with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_BASE_BRANCH``\n\

        - In ``[sessions.lint]``, ``pylint_extra_deps`` and ``mypy_extra_deps`` can
          now use package type dictionaries like ``{type = "requirements", file =
          "requirements/mypy-extra-deps.txt"}`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/133).
        - Make codecov upload for the shared nox workflow more flexible by allowing
          to disable it for specific event types (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/132).
        - Provide a new shared workflow ``.github/workflows/reusable-nox-run`` that
          allows to run nox with change detection (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/128).
        - 'The GitHub antsibull-nox action and the shared workflow support change
          detection.

          To enable change detection for PRs, simply set the workflow parameter ``change-detection-in-prs``

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix ``mypy`` invocation in ``typing`` session. For some reason the file
          list always ended up empty and ``mypy`` got skipped (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/137).
        - isort invocation - make sure to pass ``--src`` in an appropriate directory
          structure to ensure correct and more consistent sorting (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/134,
