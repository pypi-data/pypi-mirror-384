    """
    Create a training batch with observed and permuted pairs.

    Includes first-order interactions (A*X) which are critical for the
    discriminator to learn the association between treatment and covariates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : jax.Array, shape (n, d_x)
        Covariates
    A : jax.Array, shape (n, d_a)
        Treatments
    batch_indices : jax.Array, shape (batch_size,)

    rng_key : jax.random.PRNGKey
        PRNG key for permutation
