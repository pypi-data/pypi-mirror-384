"""stochpw - Permutation weighting for causal inference.

This package implements permutation weighting, a method for learning density ratios
via discriminative classification. It trains a discriminator to distinguish between
observed (X, A) pairs and permuted (X, A') pairs, then extracts importance weights
from the discriminator's predictions.

The package provides both a high-level sklearn-style API and low-level composable
components for integration into larger causal inference models.
