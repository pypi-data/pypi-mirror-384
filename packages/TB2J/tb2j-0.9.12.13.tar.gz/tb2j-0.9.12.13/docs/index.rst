Welcome to TB2J's documentation!
================================

 TB2J is an open-source Python package for the automatic computation of magnetic interactions (including exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) between atoms of magnetic crystals from density functional Hamiltonians based on Wannierfunctions or linear combinations of atomic orbitals.  The program is based on Greenâ€™s function method with the local rigid spin rotation treated as a perturbation.  As input, the package uses the output of either Wannier90, whichis interfaced with many density functional theory packages, or of codes based on localized orbitals (SIESTA, OpenMX and Abacus).  A minimal user-input is needed, which allows for easy integration into high-throughput workflows.

 The TB2J project is initialized in the PhyTheMa and Nanomat teams in the University of Liege.
