# Mascope Jupyter Widgets

This repository contains interactive widgets to construct data analysis notebooks for Mascope, utilizing [Mascope SDK](https://pypi.org/project/mascope_sdk/) to fetch data from the server. The package is published in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mascope-jupyter-widgets/) and therefore is publicly available.

Example notebooks are maintained in a separate (private) repository: [mascope-jupyter-notebooks](https://github.com/Karsa-Oy/mascope-jupyter-notebooks).

All developer docs are in this document:

## üöÄ Getting started

### Installation

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management, and therefore it is a prerequisite for installation. Install `uv` following [their instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Once installed, open a terminal, navigate into the repository directory `mascope-jupyter-widgets/` and run

```sh
uv sync
```

### Environment configuration

**NOTE: The `.env` file needs to be placed in the directory from which you launch the notebooks**

To load data from the Mascope database, you will need to configure the URL as well as a personal access token.

1. In the source code directory, copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the same location.
2. Generate and copy a _Jupyter Notebooks_ access token in your Mascope account management.
3. Replace placeholders in the `.env` file with the URL of your Mascope instance and your personal access token:

```sh
MASCOPE_ACCESS_TOKEN=p3R5oN4l4cC35s70Ken
MASCOPE_URL="https://org.mascope.app"
```

**Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored to prevent accidental commit of personal access tokens. Never commit your actual token to the repository.

### `binning/`

Module providing tools to bin data to mz-groups.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `BinningWidget`

  Interactive notebook widget to bin peaks of the dataset samples to mz-groups. It provides different methods and vizualisations for the binning analyze.

### `click_event_handler/`

Module providing tools to bin data to mz-groups.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `click_event_callbacks`

  Functions which can be attached as callbacks to figure click events.

- #### `ClickEventHandler`

  Class to be attached to a widget, providing the click event handling. Takes the desired callback function (from `click_event_callbacks`) as an argument.

### `filtering/`

Module providing tools to select a subset of the loaded dataset based on various filtering criteria.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `FilteringWidget`

  Interactive notebook widget to filter a subset of the data currently loaded into [`MascopeDataWrapper`](#mascopedatawrapper). With the filters applied, all the data propertites exposed by `MascopeDataWrapper` return the filtered data.

### `mascope_data/`

Module providing tools to load and interface with Mascope data.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `MascopeDataBrowser`

  Interactive notebook widget to browse and load data from Mascope server.

- #### `MascopeDataWrapper`

  A class providing a standardized interface to the data loaded from Mascope, consisting of various [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) dataframes exposed as class properties. An instance of the data wrapper is used as the input to analysis modules.

### `mass_defect/`

Module providing tools to perform mass defect analysis on the loaded dataset.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `MassDefectWidget`

  Interactive notebook widget to visualize the dataset based on mass defect, providing various ways of scaling and normalization.

### `alignment/`

Module providing tools to visualize alignment results for the `mascope-tools` module.

- #### `plot_mz_shifts_ppm`
  Function to plot m/z shifts in ppm before and after alignment correction.
- #### `compare_initial_and_corrected_spectra`
  Function to compare initial and corrected spectra using an interactive plot.

### `sample_timeseries/`

Module providing tools to perform sample peak timeseries analysis on the loaded dataset.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `SampleTimeSeriesWidget`

  Interactive notebook widget to visualize the dataset sample peak timeseries.

### `spectrum/`

Module providing tools to perform spectrum analysis on the loaded dataset.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `SpectrumWidget`

  Interactive notebook widget to visualize the dataset spectrums.

### `timeseries/`

Module providing tools to perform timeseries analysis on the loaded dataset.

Names exported to package namespace:

- #### `TimeSeriesWidget`

  Interactive notebook widget to visualize the dataset based on time, providing various ways of aggregation.

## üì° Publishing

The package is published in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mascope-jupyter-widgets/). There is a Github workflow; `.github/release.yaml` which automatically publishes a new version whenever there is a commit to the `main` branch, typically when `develop` is merged to `main`.

## üìù Git conventions

To encourage consistency and homogenousity in the Git history across developers, the guidelines presented in the [organization README](https://github.com/karsa-oy) should be followed. For project specific additions to the general guidelines, see below.

### Commit message _scopes_

Due to the relatively small size of the repository, usage of the optional _scope_ field is not encouraged.
