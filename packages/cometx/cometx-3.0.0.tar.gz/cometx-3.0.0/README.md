Open source extensions for the [Comet](https://www.comet.com/site/?utm_source=cometx&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=cometx_2022&utm_content=github) SDK.

These extensions are created and supported by the community and are
not an official project of Comet ML. We welcome contributions!

## Installation

```
pip install cometx --upgrade
```

To use these command-line functions, you can set your Comet API key and URL override using command-line flags:

```
cometx --api-key="YOUR-COMET-API-KEY" COMMAND
```

If you are a Comet on-prem user, and your installation does not use smart-keys, you'll also need to set the URL override:

```
cometx --api-key="YOUR-COMET-API-KEY" --url-override="https://your-companys-comet.com/clientlib/" COMMAND
```

## Usage

`cometx` is composed of a series of commands that are useful
independently, and can be used together to create sophisticated tools
for ML management.

### Commands

* [cometx admin](#cometx-admin)
* [cometx config](#cometx-config)
* [cometx copy](#cometx-copy)
* [cometx delete-assets](#cometx-delete-assets)

* [cometx list](#cometx-list)
* [cometx log](#cometx-log)
* [cometx reproduce](#cometx-reproduce)
* [cometx smoke-test](#cometx-smoke-test)
* [cometx update](#cometx-update)

For all commands, use the `--help` flag to get additional information.

This command shows the cometx version:

* `--version` - Display comet_ml version

This command can be used globally, or for individual commands:

* `-h, --help` - Show help message

## cometx list

This command is used to:

* get a list of all workspaces that you are a member of
* get a list of all projects in a workspace
* get a list of all experiments (by name or key) in a project

cometx list examples:

```
cometx list WORKSPACE/PROJECT/EXPERIMENT-KEY-OR-NAME
cometx list WORKSPACE/PROJECT
cometx list WORKSPACE
cometx list

## cometx copy

This command is used to:

* copy panels

> **Note**: For detailed information on copying experiments from one Comet installation to another, see [MIGRATIONS.md](https://github.com/comet-ml/cometx/blob/main/MIGRATIONS.md).

cometx copy examples:

```
cometx copy SOURCE DESTINATION
cometx copy --symlink SOURCE DESTINATION
cometx copy --path /base/path SOURCE DESTINATION
cometx copy --path ~/Downloads SOURCE DESTINATION
```

where SOURCE is:

* if not `--symlink`, "WORKSPACE/PROJECT/EXPERIMENT", "WORKSPACE/PROJECT", or "WORKSPACE" folder
* if `--symlink`, then it is a Comet path to workspace or workspace/project
* "WORKSPACE/panels" or "WORKSPACE/panels/PANEL-ZIP-FILENAME" to copy panels

where DESTINATION is:

* WORKSPACE
* WORKSPACE/PROJECT

Not all combinations are possible:

| Destination → <br/>Source ↓ | WORKSPACE            | WORKSPACE/PROJECT      |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `WORKSPACE/*/*`      | Copies all projects  | N/A                    |
| `WORKSPACE/PROJ/*`   | N/A                  | Copies all experiments |
| `WORKSPACE/PROJ/EXP` | N/A                  | Copies experiment      |

### Asset Types

* `--path PATH` - Path to prepend to workspace_src when accessing files (supports ~ for home directory)

### Using --path

The `--path` option allows you to specify a base directory where your workspace folders are located. This is useful when your downloaded experiments are stored in a specific directory structure.

Examples:
```bash
# Copy from experiments in /data/experiments/workspace
cometx copy --path /data/experiments workspace dest-workspace

# Copy from experiments in your home directory
cometx copy --path ~ workspace dest-workspace

# Copy from experiments in Downloads folder
cometx copy --path ~/Downloads workspace dest-workspace
```

For more information, `cometx copy --help`

## Copy/Download Use Cases

In this section we'll explore some common scenarios.

1. Copy a specific project from one Comet installation to another
2. Copy all projects in workspace to a new workspace
3. Copy specific experiments in a project to new experiments

### 1. Copy a specific project from one comet installation to another

A useful idiom is to set your Comet environment variables on the line
of a command. In this manner, you can set the `COMET_URL_OVERRIDE`
and `COMET_API_KEY` for different installations.

Of course, you don't have to set the environment variables if you are
copying experiments on the same Comet installation.

Here is how you one could download the experiments in
WORKSPACE/PROJECT from http://comet.a.com:

```shell
cometx --api-key=A-KEY download WORKSPACE/PROJECT
```

The `cometx download` command downloads all of the Comet experiment
data into local files. Note that WORKSPACE/PROJECT refers to a
workspace and project on http://comet.a.com.

One could then copy the downloaded experiment data with a similar command:

```shell
cometx --api-key=B-KEY copy WORKSPACE/PROJECT NEW-WORKSPACE/NEW-PROJECT
```

Note that WORKSPACE/PROJECT now refers to a directory, and
NEW-WORKSPACE/NEW-PROJECT refers to a workspace and project on
http://comet.b.com.

### 2. Copy all projects in workspace to a new workspace

Similarly, one can copy all of the projects by first downloading them:

```shell
cometx --api-key=A-KEY download WORKSPACE
```

and then copying them:

```shell
cometx --api-key=B-KEY copy WORKSPACE NEW-WORKSPACE
```

### 3. Copy specific experiments in a project to new experiments

Similarly, one can copy a single experiment first downloading it:

```shell
cometx --api-key=A-KEY download WORKSPACE/PROJECT/EXPERIMENT-NAME-OR-ID
```

and then copying it:

```shell
cometx --api-key=B-KEY copy WORKSPACE/PROJECT/EXPERIMENT-NAME-OR-ID NEW-WORKSPACE/NEW-PROJECT
```

## Running Tests

WARNING: Running the tests will create experiments, models, assets, etc.
in your default workspace if not set otherwise.

To run the tests, you can either export all of these items in the
environment:

```shell
$ export COMET_USER="<USERNAME>"
$ export COMET_WORKSPACE="<WORKSPACE>"
$ export COMET_API_KEY="<API-KEY>"
$ pytest tests
```

Or, define `workspace` and `api_key` in your ~/.comet.config file:

```shell
$ export COMET_USER="<USERNAME>"
$ pytest tests
```
