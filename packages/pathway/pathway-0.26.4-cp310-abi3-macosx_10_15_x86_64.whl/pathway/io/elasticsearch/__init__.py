    The rows of the table are serialized into JSON. Type conversions are the same as in

    Note that two additional fields are included in the generated JSON: ``time``, which
    indicates the time of the Pathway minibatch, and ``diff``, which can be either
    ``1`` (row addition) or ``-1`` (row deletion).

    Args:
        table: the table to output.
        host: the host and port, on which Elasticsearch server works.
        auth: credentials for Elasticsearch authorization.
        index_name: name of the index, which gets the docs.
        name: A unique name for the connector. If provided, this name will be used in
            logs and monitoring dashboards.
        sort_by: If specified, the output will be sorted in ascending order based on the
            values of the given columns within each minibatch. When multiple columns are provided,
            the corresponding value tuples will be compared lexicographically.

    Example:

    Consider there is an instance of Elasticsearch, running locally on a port ``9200``.
    There we have an index ``"animals"``, containing an information about pets and their
    owners.

    For the sake of simplicity we will also consider that the cluster has a simple
    username-password authentication having both username and password equal to ``"admin"``.

    Now suppose we want to send a Pathway table pets to this local instance of
    Elasticsearch.

    >>> import pathway as pw
    >>> pets = pw.debug.table_from_markdown('''
    ... age | owner | pet
    ... 10  | Alice | dog
    ... 9   | Bob   | cat
    ... 8   | Alice | cat
    ... ''')

    It can be done as follows:

    >>> pw.io.elasticsearch.write(
    ...     table=pets,
    ...     host="http://localhost:9200",
    ...     auth=pw.io.elasticsearch.ElasticSearchAuth.basic("admin", "admin"),
    ...     index_name="animals",
    ... )

    All the updates of table ``"pets"`` will be indexed to ``"animals"`` as well.
