    Calls a callback function on_change on every change happening in table. This method

    internal usage.

        table: the table to subscribe.
        skip_persisted_batch: whether the output for fully-persisted data should be
          ignored in case the program re-runs. The default usage is True (as not
          outputting things twice is required from persistence). However, it can be
          overridden, which is required by some parts of internal functionality.
        on_change: the callback function to be called on every change in the table. The
          function is required to accept four parameters: the key, the row changed, the time
          of the change in milliseconds and the flag stating if the change had been an
          addition of the row. These parameters of the callback are expected to have
          names row, time and is_addition respectively.
        on_time_end: the callback function to be called on each closed time of computation.
        on_end: the callback function to be called when the stream of changes ends.
        skip_errors: whether to skip rows containing errors
        name: A unique name for the connector. If provided, this name will be used in
            logs and monitoring dashboards.
        sort_by: If specified, the output will be sorted in ascending order based on the
