# ---- BCELoss (target) ----
class BCELoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""Creates a criterion that measures the Binary Cross Entropy between the target and
    the input probabilities:

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ y_n \cdot \log x_n + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - x_n) \right],

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets :math:`y` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    Notice that if :math:`x_n` is either 0 or 1, one of the log terms would be
    mathematically undefined in the above loss equation. PyTorch chooses to set
    :math:`\log (0) = -\infty`, since :math:`\lim_{x\to 0} \log (x) = -\infty`.
    However, an infinite term in the loss equation is not desirable for several reasons.

    For one, if either :math:`y_n = 0` or :math:`(1 - y_n) = 0`, then we would be
    multiplying 0 with infinity. Secondly, if we have an infinite loss value, then
    we would also have an infinite term in our gradient, since
    :math:`\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{d}{dx} \log (x) = \infty`.
    This would make BCELoss's backward method nonlinear with respect to :math:`x_n`,
    and using it for things like linear regression would not be straight-forward.

    Our solution is that BCELoss clamps its log function outputs to be greater than
    or equal to -100. This way, we can always have a finite loss value and a linear
    backward method.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to the loss
            of each batch element. If given, has to be a Tensor of size `nbatch`.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`, where :math:`*` means any number of dimensions.
        - Target: :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(*)`, same
          shape as input.

    Examples:

        >>> m = nn.Sigmoid()
        >>> loss = nn.BCELoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 2, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.rand(3, 2, requires_grad=False)
        >>> output = loss(m(input), target)
        >>> output.backward()
