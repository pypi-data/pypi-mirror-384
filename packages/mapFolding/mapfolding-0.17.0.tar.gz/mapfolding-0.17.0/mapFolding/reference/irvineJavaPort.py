"""Ported from the Java version by Sean A. Irvine.

This implementation is a Python version of a Java implementation of Lunnon's algorithm by Sean A. Irvine.

Key characteristics:
- Identifiers tend to match Irvine.
- A procedural paradigm more similar to Lunnon and unlike Irvine's object-oriented implementation.
- Only primitive Python data structures.
