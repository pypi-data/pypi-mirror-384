"""
Persistent storage infrastructure for map folding computation results.

(AI generated docstring)

As computational state management orchestrates the complex recursive analysis,
this module ensures that the valuable results of potentially multi-day computations
are safely preserved and reliably retrievable. Map folding problems can require
extensive computational time, making robust result persistence critical for
practical research and application.

The storage system provides standardized filename generation, platform-independent
path resolution, and multiple fallback strategies to prevent data loss. Special
attention is given to environments like Google Colab and cross-platform deployment
scenarios. The storage patterns integrate with the configuration foundation to
provide consistent behavior across different installation contexts.

This persistence layer serves as the crucial bridge between the computational
framework and the user interface, ensuring that computation results are available
for the main interface to retrieve, validate, and present to users seeking
solutions to their map folding challenges.

	(AI generated docstring)

	This function generates a consistent, filesystem-safe filename based on map dimensions. Standardizing filenames
	ensures that results can be reliably stored and retrieved, avoiding potential filesystem incompatibilities or Python
	naming restrictions.

	Parameters
	----------
	mapShape : tuple[int, ...]
		A sequence of integers representing the dimensions of the map.

	Returns
	-------
	filenameFoldsTotal : str
		A filename string in format 'pMxN.foldsTotal' where M,N are sorted dimensions.

	Notes
	-----
	The filename format ensures no spaces in the filename, safe filesystem characters, unique extension (.foldsTotal),
	Python-safe strings (no starting with numbers, no reserved words), and the 'p' prefix comes from Lunnon's original code.

	Parameters
	----------
	pathFilename : PathLike[str] | PurePath
		The path and filename where computation results will be saved.

	Raises
	------
	FileExistsError
		If the target file already exists.
	FileNotFoundError
		If parent directories don't exist or if write tests fail.

	Notes
	-----
	Checks performed:
	1. Checks if the file already exists to prevent accidental overwrites.
	2. Verifies that parent directories exist.
	3. Tests if the system can write a test value to the file.
	4. Confirms that the written value can be read back correctly.

	This function helps prevent a situation where a computation runs for hours or days only to discover at the end
	that results cannot be saved. The test value used is a large integer that exercises both the writing and
	reading mechanisms thoroughly.
