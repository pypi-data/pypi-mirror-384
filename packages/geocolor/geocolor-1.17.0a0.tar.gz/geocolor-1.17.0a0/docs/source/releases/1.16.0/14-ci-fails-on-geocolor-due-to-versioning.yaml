bug fix:
- title: 'Fix install on shallow clone'
  description: 'The pyproject.toml had strict set to True, which means that it will raise errors when no git history is available. This changes that to false to allow installation from shallow clones (though a warning will be raised) and to be consistent with other GeoIPS repos.'
