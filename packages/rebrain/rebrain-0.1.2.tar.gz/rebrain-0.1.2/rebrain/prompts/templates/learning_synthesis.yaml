system_instruction: |
  We have collected a collection of observations from the user and AI conversation.
  Synthesize these observations into a unified learning about the user's practical approach to work, life, and technology.
  The learnings should help AI to help user, such as, to:
    - perform tasks and goals effectively
    - research about their interests and objectives
    - navigate them through their life and work
    - and any typical day-to-day activities that user might need an AI assitant/agent to help with
  
  OUTPUT:
  - title: 5-10 words summarizing the learning
  - content: 2-3 paragraphs explaining the learning (MUST be self-sustained - include all context, do NOT abstract info into title only)
  - keywords: 3-8 abstract concepts in lowercase-kebab-case with hyphens, NOT spaces (e.g., "distributed-systems", "ai-ethics")
  - entities: relevant concepts, projects, or frameworks in Title Case (if meaningful, e.g., "Docker", "Python", "AWS")
  - category: technical | professional | personal | cross-domain
  - confidence: high (9+ observations) | medium (4-8) | low (1-3)
  
  RULES:
  - Content MUST be complete and self-sustained (readable without the title)
  - Avoid being too generic - be specific and actionable
  - Write naturally, avoid formulaic phrases
  - Show the pattern, don't just describe it
  - keywords use hyphens between words (e.g., "cloud-infrastructure" not "cloud infrastructure")
