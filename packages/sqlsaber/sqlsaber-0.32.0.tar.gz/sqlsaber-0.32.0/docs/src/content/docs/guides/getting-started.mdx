Welcome to SQLsaber! This guide will walk you through setting up SQLsaber and running your first query.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. [Installed SQLsaber](/installation)
2. Access to a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or DuckDB)
3. An API key from a supported AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)

### Quick Setup

#### 1. Set Up Authentication

First, configure your AI provider.

SQLsaber uses Claude Sonnet 4 as the model by default, but supports models from [multiple providers](/guides/models).

```bash
saber auth setup
```

This will prompt you to:

- Choose a provider (We recommend Anthropic)
- Enter your API key

<Aside type="tip">
  If you have a Claude Pro or Max subscription, you can use it with SQLsaber. It
  is one of the most cost-effective options.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  If you choose a provider other than Anthropic, please select the appropriate
  model for the provider by running `saber models set`.
</Aside>

#### 2. Add Your Database

Add a database connection:

```bash
saber db add my-database
```

This interactive command will ask you for:

- Database type
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL
  - SQLite
  - DuckDB
- Connection details (host, port, database name, username)
- SSL configuration (if needed)

<Aside type="note">
If you don't have a database handy, you can use a sample `legislators` SQLite database from SQLsaber repository:

```bash
curl -L -o legislators.db https://github.com/SarthakJariwala/sqlsaber/raw/refs/heads/main/legislators.db

# Add it to SQLsaber
saber db add legislators --type sqlite --database ./legislators.db
```

</Aside>

#### 3. Your First Query

Now you're ready to ask your first question!

Start SQLsaber in interactive mode:

```bash
saber
```

Try asking a question:

```
> How many VPs have become presidents via election in 20th century?
```

SQLsaber will:

1. Analyze your database schema
2. Generate appropriate SQL
3. Execute the query
4. Present the results and analysis

<script
  src="https://asciinema.org/a/39e71PIiGJetHBPy08L1TOotB.js"
  id="asciicast-39e71PIiGJetHBPy08L1TOotB"
  async="true"
></script>

### Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, you have access to several helpful features:

- Slash Commands
  - `/clear` - Clear the conversation history
  - `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit SQLsaber

- Table Name Autocomplete
  - Type `@` followed by a table name to get autocomplete suggestions:

### Non-Interactive Mode

You can also run single queries without entering interactive mode:

```bash
# Direct query
saber "How many users are there?"

# Using a specific database
saber -d my-database "Show me the latest orders"

# Reading from stdin
echo "Count all products by category" | saber

# Send output to a file
saber "Show me the latest orders" > latest_orders.md
```

### Next Steps

Now that you have SQLsaber running, explore these features:

- **[Set up memory](/guides/memory)** - Add context about your database for better results
- **[Manage conversation threads](/guides/threads)** - Resume your conversations
- **[Configure different models](/guides/models)** - Try different AI models
- **[Advanced database setup](/guides/database-setup)** - Configure SSL, connection strings, and more
