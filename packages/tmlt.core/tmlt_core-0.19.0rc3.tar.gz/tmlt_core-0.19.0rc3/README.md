# Tumult Core

Tumult Core is a programming framework for implementing [differentially private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) algorithms.

The design of Tumult Core is based on the design proposed in the [OpenDP White Paper](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/opendifferentialprivacy/files/opendp_white_paper_11may2020.pdf), and can automatically verify the privacy properties of algorithms constructed from Tumult Core components. Tumult Core is scalable, includes a wide variety of components, and supports multiple privacy definitions.
