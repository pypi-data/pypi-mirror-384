# Canvas MCP for Educators

Welcome! This guide will help you set up Canvas MCP to enhance your teaching with AI-powered course management tools.

## What Can Canvas MCP Do for You?

Canvas MCP provides AI-powered assistance for common teaching workflows:

- **Assignment Management**: Track submissions, identify missing work, analyze completion rates
- **Grading & Rubrics**: Manage rubrics, grade submissions, provide feedback
- **Student Analytics**: Monitor student performance, identify at-risk students, track engagement
- **Peer Review Management**: Track peer review completion, analyze review quality, send reminders
- **Discussion Facilitation**: Monitor discussions, respond to students, analyze participation
- **Communication**: Send targeted messages, create announcements, automate reminders
- **FERPA Compliance**: Built-in data anonymization for AI-safe student analytics

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** installed on your computer
- **Claude Desktop** - Download from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/download)
- **Canvas Account** with instructor/TA permissions

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp.git
cd canvas-mcp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install uv package manager (faster than pip)
pip install uv

# Install Canvas MCP
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. Get Your Canvas API Token

1. Log in to your Canvas account
2. Go to **Account** â†’ **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Approved Integrations**
4. Click **+ New Access Token**
5. Give it a purpose (e.g., "Claude AI Teaching Assistant")
6. Click **Generate Token**
7. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't see it again!

### 4. Configure Canvas MCP

Create a `.env` file in the `canvas-mcp` directory:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp env.template .env

# Edit the .env file and add your credentials
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
# Canvas API Configuration
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
CANVAS_API_URL=https://canvas.youruniversity.edu

# MCP Server Configuration (optional)
MCP_SERVER_NAME=canvas-mcp

# Privacy Settings (IMPORTANT for FERPA compliance)
ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true  # Anonymizes student data before AI processing
ANONYMIZATION_DEBUG=false       # Set to true for debugging only

# Optional: Institution name for display
INSTITUTION_NAME=Your University Name
```

**Important Configuration Notes:**
- Replace `https://canvas.youruniversity.edu` with your actual Canvas URL
- **Set `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`** for FERPA-compliant student data handling
- The anonymization system converts student names to anonymous IDs (e.g., "Student_abc123") before sending data to AI

### 5. Configure Claude Desktop

Add Canvas MCP to Claude Desktop's configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas-api": {
      "command": "canvas-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Test the Canvas API connection
canvas-mcp-server --test

# View your configuration
canvas-mcp-server --config
```

You should see: âœ“ API connection successful!

### 7. Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop. You should see the ðŸ”¨ hammer icon when you start a conversation.

## FERPA Compliance & Privacy

### How Data Anonymization Works

When `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true` is set, Canvas MCP automatically:

1. **Converts student names** to anonymous IDs (e.g., "John Smith" â†’ "Student_abc123")
2. **Masks email addresses** (e.g., "john@university.edu" â†’ "student_abc123@masked")
3. **Filters PII** from discussion posts and submissions (phone numbers, SSNs)
4. **Maintains consistency** - same student always gets the same anonymous ID
5. **Preserves relationships** - you can still identify patterns and trends

### De-Anonymization Mapping

The system creates local mapping files that let you correlate anonymous IDs with real students:

```
local_maps/
â””â”€â”€ course_BADM_350_mapping.csv
```

This CSV file maps anonymous IDs back to real names - **keep it secure and never commit to version control**.

### Privacy Best Practices

- **Enable anonymization** - Always set `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`
- **Secure your token** - Never share or commit your Canvas API token
- **Protect mapping files** - Keep `local_maps/` folder secure (it's in `.gitignore`)
- **Local processing only** - All data stays on your machine; nothing sent to external servers
- **Review before sharing** - If sharing Claude conversations, ensure student data is anonymous
