# Course Documentation Generator - Prompt Template (Hybrid Approach)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**
This template helps instructors systematically document their courses for project knowledge storage, enabling efficient course management and future reuse. This hybrid approach balances static documentation with live Canvas MCP access to maintain accuracy while optimizing performance.

## ðŸ”„ **Hybrid Documentation Strategy**

### **Static Documentation (Generate Once, Update Periodically)**
Use these prompts to create foundational course documents that capture stable, design-level information:
- Course structure and philosophy
- Assignment templates and rubrics  
- Communication templates
- Resource guides and support materials

### **Live MCP Integration (Real-time Access)**
Use Canvas MCP tools for dynamic, frequently-changing data:
- Current student progress and grades
- Recent discussion activity
- Assignment submissions and feedback
- Real-time enrollment and participation data

### **Best Practices for Hybrid Approach**
1. **Document Creation Date**: Always include timestamps in generated docs
2. **Refresh Triggers**: Update static docs when course structure changes significantly
3. **Validation Workflow**: Before major decisions, verify key facts with MCP tools
4. **Version Control**: Track document versions across semesters
