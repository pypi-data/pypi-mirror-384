# Code Interpretation

A code interpreter is a specialized [tool](/docs/function_call_definition) that enables the assistant to create and execute Python code in a secure, sandboxed environment.

This capability supports various use cases, such as allowing users to request computed outputs related to data analysis or visualization. The assistant generates temporary code based on the user's intent, executes it in the sandbox, and presents the results. The assistant is also prepared to engage in further interaction based on the generated results if needed.
