    Convert Becker and Hickl fcs data to correlation curves stored in .csv files

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : string
        File name with BH single photon arrival times (.asc file).
    bintime : float, optional
        Bin time [ns]. The default is 500.
    accuracy : int, optional
        Accuracy calculation autocorrelation. The default is 50.
    split : int, optional
        Number of fragments in which to split the time trace.
        For each fragment the autocorrelation is calculated, as
        well as the average correlation. The default is 20.

    Returns
    -------
    .csv file with all the correlations.
