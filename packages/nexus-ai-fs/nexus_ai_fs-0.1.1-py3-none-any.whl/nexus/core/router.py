    Route virtual paths to storage backends using mount table.

    2. **Mount Priority**: Explicit priority for overlapping mounts
    3. **Simplified for Embedded**: In-memory mounts (no database needed)

        /workspace  → LocalFS (/var/nexus/workspace)
        /shared     → LocalFS (/var/nexus/shared)
        /external   → Could be S3, GDrive, etc.
