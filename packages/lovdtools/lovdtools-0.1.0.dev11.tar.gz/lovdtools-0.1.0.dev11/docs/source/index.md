# LOVDTools Documentation

:::{admonition} Prerelease Notice
:class: warning

LOVDTools is still in early development, so its public API is liable to change
frequently and without notice. It is not yet suitable for use in production environments.
:::

[``lovdtools``](https://github.com/hyletic/lovdtools.git) is a Python package
that provides configurable utilities for acquiring variant records from the
Global Variome shared Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) instance. It abstracts
away much of the complexity surrounding large-scale data requisitions by wrapping
the LOVD data retrieval API in a fluent Python interface suitable both for scripting
and interactive use cases. Originally written to support his ongoing research on
genotypic variance in the manifestation of the Ehlersâ€“Danlos Syndromes, this tool
is provided by [``@hyletic``](https://github.com/hyletic) to the public, free of
charge, in hopes that it might one day serve to make these data more accessible
to clinicians, researchers, and patients alike.

## Quick Start

```python
from lovd import LOVDClient

# Initialize the client with logging and progress indication enabled.
client = LOVDClient().with_logging().with_progress()

# Fetch variant records for all genes in `client.target_gene_symbols`.
variants = client.get_variants_for_genes()
```

## Features

- **Fluent API**: Intuitive Python interface for LOVD data retrieval
- **Flexible Filtering**: Search variants by gene, pathogenicity, disease, and more
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in respect for server limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Data Export**: Easy conversion to pandas, JSON, CSV formats
