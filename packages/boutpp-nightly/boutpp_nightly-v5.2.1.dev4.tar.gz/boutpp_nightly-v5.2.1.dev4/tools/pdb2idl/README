PDB2IDL library
===============

This library enables IDL to read and write Portable Data Binary (PDB)
files. 

Requirements
------------

To install and use this library you will need:

1. A PACT installation, available from http://pact.llnl.gov

2. IDL. Tested on 6.3

Installation
------------

Make sure you have a PACT environment variable pointing to your PACT
installation.
e.g. in BASH
$ export PACT=/usr/local/
or CSH
# setenv PACT /usr/local

IDL includes an automatic compilation tool which should work if you run:

$ idl compile.pro

You should now have a shared library (e.g. pdb2idl.so) in the current directory.
If this method fails, you can try using

$ ./configure
$ make

which should work on many UNIX systems, particularly Linux.

At this point you should have a shared library which can be used by IDL.
This file needs to be put somewhere in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH such as
/usr/local/lib/ or /usr/lib

To use PDB2IDL from within IDL, you also need the pdb2idl.pro file, which is
in the idllib directory included with BOUT++. This directory should be included
in your IDL_PATH environment variable.
This should be compiled before you can use any of the routines by running

IDL> .r pdb2idl

(I recommend putting this into your IDL startup file)
