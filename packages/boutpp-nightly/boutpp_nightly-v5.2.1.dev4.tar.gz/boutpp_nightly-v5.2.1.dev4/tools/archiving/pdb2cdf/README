Handles up to 4-D integers, floats and doubles. Tries to assign the correct
dimensions to the variables using the following procedure:

1. Find the variable with the largest number of dimensions
2. Labels the dimensions of this variable 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'T'
   (always in that order), and records the index ranges
3. For each variable, match index ranges to get the dimension,
   using the first one which matches. Dimensions are assumed
   to always be in the same order: XZ, YT, XY etc. but NOT ZX, TZ etc.
4. Variables which cannot be matched to dimensions will currently 
   cause the code to fall over. Should be improved later.

The ordering of dimensions was chosen for BOUT++ files, but
apart from this, the code is not specific to BOUT++.
