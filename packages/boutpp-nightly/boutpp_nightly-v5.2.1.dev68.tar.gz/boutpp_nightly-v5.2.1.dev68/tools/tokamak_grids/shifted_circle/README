To generate a shifted circle equilibrium, do the following

IDL> generate

This will go around a loop of asking for parameters and displaying the
resulting equilibrium. Once you're happy with the result, UEDGE-style
output files will be produced. 

To convert these files into a BOUT++ input grid, go to the "all" directory,
and run

IDL> uedge2bout, path="/path/to/files/", output="output_grid.nc"

This will then ask some more questions and output a BOUT++ grid file.
