Solving Staggered Fields Test
=============================

This test checks that BOUT++ doesn't hang when trying to apply boundary
conditions on boundaries that exist only on certain processes. This version
doesn't use BoutInitialise(). See
https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/issues/1369 for the original problem.
