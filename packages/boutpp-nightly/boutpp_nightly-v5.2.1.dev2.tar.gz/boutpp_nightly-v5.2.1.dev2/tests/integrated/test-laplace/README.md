test-laplace
============

Test Laplacian inversion routines with several different flag combinations, on
different number of processes, checking the results against existing benchmarks.

This test uses both the old-style free function `invert_laplace`, as well as the
new class interface `Laplacian`.

For details on the flags used, see the Laplacian inversion documentation.
