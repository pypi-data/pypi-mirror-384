**Trailpack proposes a standard way to link data and specialized metadata in one single file.** It provides a simple interface to link metadata to fixed ontologies, improving the accessibility and comparability of datasets from different sources.

## What is Trailpack?

Trailpack combines metadata and data into a single [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) file, making open data more accessible and sustainable. It validates metadata against developed standards including:

- **General metadata** for the data package (name, license, contributors)
- **Specialized metadata** for each data column - linking both column names and units to fixed descriptions in ontologies provided by [PyST](https://vocab.sentier.dev)

The developed standard expands on and is compatible with the [Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/) specification. The metadata is included under the `datapackage.json` keyword in the Parquet file.

The output file is readable using [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) and other data handlers - and will be compatible and consumable using [Sentier data tools](https://github.com/sentier-dev/sentier_data_tools).

**Origin:** Trailpack was initially built during the hackathon of Brightcon 2025 in Grenoble, as part of developing the standard data format for [D√©part de Sentier](https://www.d-d-s.ch/).

## Installation

You can install _trailpack_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install trailpack
```

[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/
[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/

## Usage

### Web Application

The easiest way to use Trailpack is through the **[web application](https://trailpack.streamlit.app/)**.

The web app provides a step-by-step workflow:
1. **Upload File & Select Language**: Upload an Excel file and select language for PyST mapping
2. **Select Sheet**: Choose which sheet to process with data preview
3. **Map Columns**: Map each column to PyST concepts with automatic suggestions
4. **General Details**: Provide package metadata (name, title, license, contributors)
5. **Download**: Get your standardized Parquet file with embedded metadata

For walkthrough videos demonstrating the workflow, see the [documentation](https://trailpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/usage.html).

### Local Web UI

You can also run the Streamlit UI locally:

```bash
# Run the UI
trailpack ui
```

For more details, see [trailpack/ui/README.md](trailpack/ui/README.md).

**Deploying to Streamlit Cloud?** See [STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md](STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

### Python API

For advanced users and programmatic workflows, you can use Trailpack directly in Python. See the [example notebook](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/trailpack/blob/main/examples/example_packing.ipynb) for a complete walkthrough.

```python
from trailpack.excel import ExcelReader
from trailpack.pyst.api.client import get_suggest_client

# Read Excel structure
reader = ExcelReader("data.xlsx")
sheets = reader.sheets()
columns = reader.columns("Sheet1")

# Get PyST suggestions
client = get_suggest_client()
suggestions = await client.suggest("carbon footprint", "en")
```
## üì¶ DataPackage Schema Classes

Trailpack includes comprehensive schema classes for building [Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/) metadata:

### Key Features
- **`DataPackageSchema`**: Defines field types, validation rules, and UI configuration
- **`MetaDataBuilder`**: Fluent interface for creating metadata programmatically
- **Field validation**: Built-in validation for package names, versions, URLs
- **UI integration ready**: Field definitions include labels, placeholders, patterns
- **Standards compliant**: Follows Frictionless Data Package specification

### Quick Example
```python
from trailpack.packing.datapackage_schema import MetaDataBuilder, Resource

# Create metadata with fluent interface
metadata = (MetaDataBuilder()
    .set_basic_info(name="my-dataset", title="My Dataset")
    .add_license("CC-BY-4.0")
    .add_contributor("Your Name", "author")
    .add_resource(Resource(name="data", path="data.parquet"))
    .build())

# Use with Packing class
from trailpack.packing import Packing
packer = Packing(df, metadata)
packer.write_parquet("output.parquet")
```

### UI Integration
The schema classes provide everything needed for UI frameworks:
- Field definitions with types, labels, validation patterns
- Enumerated options for dropdowns (licenses, profiles, etc.)
- Built-in validation methods
- Error messages for invalid input

## üîç Validation System

Trailpack includes a comprehensive validation system to ensure data quality and standards compliance:

### Features
- ‚úÖ **Metadata validation**: Required fields, naming conventions, license checking
- ‚úÖ **Data quality metrics**: Missing values and duplicates (logged as info, not errors)
- ‚úÖ **Type consistency**: Mixed types and schema matching (raises errors)
- ‚úÖ **Unit requirements**: All numeric fields must have units (including dimensionless)
- ‚úÖ **Compliance levels**: STRICT, STANDARD, BASIC, or NON-COMPLIANT

### Quick Example
```python
from trailpack.validation import StandardValidator

# Create validator
validator = StandardValidator("1.0.0")

# Validate everything
result = validator.validate_all(
    metadata=metadata_dict,
    df=dataframe,
    schema=schema_dict
)

# Check results
if result.is_valid:
    print(f"{result.level}")  # e.g., "‚úÖ STRICT COMPLIANCE"
else:
    print(result)  # Shows all errors and warnings
```

### Unit Requirements
All numeric fields must specify units, even for dimensionless quantities:
- **Measurements**: Use SI or domain units (kg, m, ¬∞C)
- **IDs/Counts**: Use dimensionless unit (`http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/NUM`)
- **Percentages**: Use percent or dimensionless

See [trailpack/validation/README.md](trailpack/validation/README.md) for complete documentation.
