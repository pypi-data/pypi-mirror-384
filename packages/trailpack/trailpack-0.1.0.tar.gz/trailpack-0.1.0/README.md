## Installation

You can install _trailpack_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install trailpack
```

## Usage

### Web UI

Trailpack includes a Streamlit-based web UI for mapping Excel columns to PyST concepts:

```bash
# Run the UI
streamlit run trailpack/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

Or using the run script:

```bash
python trailpack/ui/run_streamlit.py
```

The UI provides a 3-step workflow with smooth transitions:
1. **Upload File & Select Language**: Upload an Excel file and select language for PyST mapping
2. **Select Sheet**: Choose which sheet to process with data preview
3. **Map Columns**: Map each column to PyST concepts with automatic suggestions and dataframe preview

The view object is stored internally for further processing.

For more details, see [trailpack/ui/README.md](trailpack/ui/README.md).

**Deploying to Streamlit Cloud?** See [STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md](STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

### Python API

You can also use trailpack programmatically:

```python
from trailpack.excel import ExcelReader
from trailpack.pyst.api.client import get_suggest_client

# Read Excel structure
reader = ExcelReader("data.xlsx")
sheets = reader.sheets()
columns = reader.columns("Sheet1")

# Get PyST suggestions
client = get_suggest_client()
suggestions = await client.suggest("carbon footprint", "en")
```
## âœ¨ New: UI-Ready DataPackage Schema Classes

This project now includes comprehensive schema classes for building data package metadata through user interfaces:

### Key Features
- **`DataPackageSchema`**: Defines field types, validation rules, and UI configuration
- **`MetaDataBuilder`**: Fluent interface for creating metadata programmatically
- **Field validation**: Built-in validation for package names, versions, URLs
- **UI integration ready**: Field definitions include labels, placeholders, patterns
- **Standards compliant**: Follows Frictionless Data Package specification

### Quick Example
```python
from trailpack.datapackage_schema import MetaDataBuilder, Resource, Field

# Create metadata with fluent interface
metadata = (MetaDataBuilder()
    .set_basic_info(name="my-dataset", title="My Dataset")
    .add_license("CC-BY-4.0")
    .add_contributor("Your Name", "author")
    .add_resource(Resource(name="data", path="data.parquet"))
    .build())

# Use with existing Packing class
from trailpack.packing import Packing
packer = Packing(df, metadata)
packer.write_parquet("output.parquet")
```

### UI Integration
The schema classes provide everything needed for UI frameworks:
- Field definitions with types, labels, validation patterns
- Enumerated options for dropdowns (licenses, profiles, etc.)
- Built-in validation methods
- Error messages for invalid input

See `examples/datapackage_ui_demo.py` for detailed usage examples.
