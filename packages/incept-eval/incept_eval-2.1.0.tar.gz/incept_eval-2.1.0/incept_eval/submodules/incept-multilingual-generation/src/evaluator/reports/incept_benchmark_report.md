## Evaluation Methodology

### Overview

Our benchmark evaluation uses the **EduBench framework**, a comprehensive educational assessment system designed to evaluate AI-generated educational questions across three critical dimensions. All questions undergo rigorous quality control with a minimum threshold score of **8.0/10.0** to ensure only high-quality questions are included in our benchmark dataset.

### Three-Dimensional Evaluation Framework

#### 1. Question Answering (QA) - Weight: 35%

**Purpose:** Measures the factual correctness and accuracy of the generated questions and answers.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correctness of the answer key
- Clarity and unambiguity of the question
- Alignment between question and provided answer
- Absence of misleading or incorrect information

**Scoring:** Questions are evaluated by comparing generated answers against gold standard answers extracted from UAE Ministry of Education curriculum materials. A score of 10/10 indicates perfect factual accuracy, while lower scores reflect degrees of incorrectness or ambiguity.

#### 2. Educational Curriculum Alignment (EC) - Weight: 45%

**Purpose:** Assesses how well questions align with official educational standards and curriculum requirements.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Alignment with UAE Ministry of Education curriculum standards
- Appropriate difficulty level for target grade
- Coverage of relevant learning objectives
- Pedagogical appropriateness for the subject area
- Cultural and linguistic appropriateness for Arabic education

**Scoring:** This dimension receives the highest weight (45%) as curriculum alignment is critical for educational validity. Questions must not only be correct but also relevant to what students are expected to learn at each grade level.

#### 3. Inference & Pedagogy (IP) - Weight: 20%

**Purpose:** Evaluates the cognitive depth and pedagogical quality of questions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Level of critical thinking required
- Application of knowledge vs. rote memorization
- Scaffolding and hint quality (when applicable)
- Progressive difficulty and learning progression
- Encouragement of deeper understanding

**Scoring:** Questions that require higher-order thinking skills (analysis, synthesis, evaluation) score higher than those testing only recall or comprehension.

### Weighted Scoring Formula

The final weighted score for each question is calculated as:

```
Weighted Score = (QA × 0.35) + (EC × 0.45) + (IP × 0.20)
```

This weighting emphasizes curriculum alignment as the most critical factor, followed by factual accuracy, with pedagogical depth as an important but secondary consideration.

### Quality Assurance Process

1. **Question Generation:** Questions are generated by the Incept Orchestrator Pipeline
2. **Automated Evaluation:** All questions undergo automated EduBench evaluation
3. **Quality Filtering:** Only questions scoring ≥8.0/10.0 are retained in the dataset
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Benchmarks are updated weekly with new evaluation data
5. **Data Validation:** Regular audits ensure evaluation consistency and accuracy
