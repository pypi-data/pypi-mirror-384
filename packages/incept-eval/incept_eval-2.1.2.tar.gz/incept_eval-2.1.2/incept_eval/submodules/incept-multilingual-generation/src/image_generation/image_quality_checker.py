CRITICAL RULE FOR EDUCATIONAL IMAGES:
If the image shows the answer or calculated values that the student is supposed to figure out, you MUST REJECT it. Educational diagrams should only show given information, not reveal solutions.

SPECIAL RULE FOR SVG COUNTING/ARITHMETIC IMAGES:
SVG images should contain NO descriptive text or labels (like "apples", "total", "sum", etc.). Numbers are acceptable ONLY when showing mathematical operations or quantities. Any descriptive text or labeling should result in REJECTION.

SPECIAL RULE FOR VENN DIAGRAMS:
Venn diagrams should show ONLY set labels (e.g., "Math", "Science") and proper overlapping structure. They should NOT show any numbers - neither given values nor calculated answers. This provides a clean visual framework for students to organize their thinking without revealing solutions.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Accuracy to Description** (40% weight)
   - Does the image accurately represent what was requested?
   - Are all required elements present?
   - Is the content mathematically/scientifically correct?
   - Do the objects in the image match the description?
   - CRITICAL: Does it reveal the answer that students should calculate? If yes, REJECT

2. **Educational Value** (30% weight)
   - Is the image clear and easy to understand for the target age group?
   - Does it effectively communicate the concept?
   - Would it help students learn?
   - Does it preserve the learning challenge by not revealing answers?

3. **Visual Clarity** (20% weight)
   - Is the image well-organized and uncluttered?
   - For SVG counting/arithmetic images: NO descriptive text or labels should be present (numbers for math operations are OK)
   - Is the color scheme appropriate?
   - For counting/arithmetic problems: Are all objects fully visible with no unwanted overlap? Can students easily count individual items?
   - For Venn diagrams: Are overlapping regions clearly defined and appropriate for the concept?

4. **Technical Quality** (10% weight)
   - Is the image sharp and well-rendered?
   - Are there any visual artifacts or errors?

## Response Format

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with:
{
  "rankings": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "image_index": <0-based index>,
      "score": <0-100>,

      "recommendation": "ACCEPT" or "REJECT"
    }
  ],
  "best_image_index": <index of best image>,
  "overall_feedback": "Summary of the evaluation"
}

**IMPORTANT for changes_required field:**
- For REJECTED images, provide specific, actionable changes that can be used directly in regeneration prompts
- Focus on concrete modifications like "Change the count from 4 to 5 apples", "Make all apples fully visible with no overlap", "Remove the total number 12 from the image"
- Be precise about positioning, counts, colors, arrangements, or content changes needed
- For ACCEPTED images, this field can be empty or contain minor suggested improvements

Only recommend ACCEPT for images that score 70 or above."""

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Accuracy** (Critical)
   - Does the image show what was requested?
   - Are all elements correct and properly positioned?
   - Is it mathematically/scientifically accurate?

2. **Educational Appropriateness**
   - Is it suitable for the target age group?
   - Does it clearly communicate the concept?
   - Is it free from distracting elements?

3. **Visual Quality**
   - Is the image clear and well-organized?
   - Are any labels or text readable?
   - Is the style appropriate for educational content?
   - Are the objects visually appealing

**Important Guidelines:**
- PASS: Score â‰¥ 70, image accurately represents the concept with minor issues at most
- FAIL: Score < 70, significant inaccuracies or quality issues

**Provide Complete Feedback: If you rate an image as a FAIL, you must provide complete, specific, detailed feedback about ALL issues with the image. Do not leave out any feedback about shortcomings for any reason. The image will be improved based only on what you provide feedback on, so you MUST describe every error and how to fix it in your response.**"""
