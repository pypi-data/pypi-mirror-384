    # The `firstName`, `lastName`, `secondName` etc. properties intentionally do not use
    # the `name` property type. Many FtM tools (including Aleph) use name properties to
    # compare/match entities, but matching entites just on e.g. a first name would lead to
    # too many false positives.
