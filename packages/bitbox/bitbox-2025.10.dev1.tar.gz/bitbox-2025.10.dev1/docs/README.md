# Overview

<h2 align="center">Bitbox</h2>

**Bitbox is the open-source Python library for computational analysis of nonverbal human behavior.** Bitbox  makes it easy to study facial expressions, head and body actions, eye gaze (coming soon), and speech behavior (coming soon) from videos and images.

Bitbox gives you all tools you need to study motor, social, emotional behavior.

* Psychomotor function: spatial extent, smoothness, speed, energy, temporal phases&#x20;
* Affective expression: expressive motion units, symmetry, expressivity, diversity, arousal/valence (coming soon)
* Interpersonal dynamics: imitation, coordination, social gaze (coming soon), speech behavior (coming soon)

Bitbox can run on a laptop as a standalone processor, currently requiring an NVIDIA GPU. If more computational power is needed, Bitbox can also operate on a powerful server, providing a <mark style="color:purple;">`Python`</mark> client API. Additionally, Bitbox can be used on a high-performance computing cluster by submitting SLURM jobs (coming soon).
