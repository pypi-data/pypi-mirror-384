# Backend Processors

<h2 align="center">Backend Processors</h2>

Bitbox supports multiple backend processors for face, body (coming soon), and speech behavior (coming soon). Bitbox provides standardized interfaces and output formats across different processors, so users generally don't need to know about the inner workings of these processors.&#x20;

> **Note:** We're expanding our list of supported backend processors. Have a favorite tool you'd like to see in Bitbox? Let us know on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/compsygroup/bitbox/issues) page.
