`bisocket` is a high-level Python library that simplifies bidirectional (two-way) communication over sockets. It provides a robust framework for building client-server applications that require sending and receiving data simultaneously without blocking.

It comes with built-in **AES-GCM end-to-end encryption** and **bz2 compression**, ensuring your data is secure and transmitted efficiently. The library offers both synchronous (threading-based) and asynchronous (`asyncio`) APIs, making it versatile for various application architectures.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  - **True Bidirectional Communication**: Uses separate sockets for sending and receiving, enabling non-blocking, full-duplex communication.
  - **End-to-End Encryption**: Automatic AES-GCM encryption for all messages ensures data privacy and integrity.
  - **Data Compression**: Automatic `bz2` compression reduces bandwidth usage for large payloads.
  - **Sync & Async Support**: Provides both a standard threading API and a modern `asyncio` API.
  - **Simple Handler-Based API**: Use a clean handler function on the server and an `on_receive` callback on the client to process messages.
  - **Unique Client Identification**: Manages clients using unique UUIDs, making it easy to track connections.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install `bisocket` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install bisocket
```

The only dependency is the `cryptography` library for encryption.

-----

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here‚Äôs a simple echo client and server to get you started.

### 1\. Set the Encryption Key

For security, `bisocket` requires an encryption key. Set it as an environment variable. If it's not set, the library will use a default, **insecure** key suitable only for testing.

```bash
export CRYPTO_KEY='your-super-secret-and-long-encryption-key'
```

### 2\. Synchronous Example

#### Server (`server.py`)

```python
from bisocket import Server, ServerRequest

# Define a handler to process incoming requests.
def handler(request: ServerRequest):
    print(f"Received method '{request.method}' with data: {request.data.decode()}")

    if request.method == 'echo':
        # Send the received data back to the client.
        request.send_data(request.data)
    elif request.method == 'ping':
        request.send_data(b'pong')

# Create and start the server.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = Server(host='127.0.0.1', port=65432, handler=handler)
    print("Starting synchronous server on port 65432...")
    server.start()
```

#### Client (`client.py`)

```python
import time
from bisocket import Client, Message

# Define a callback to handle messages from the server.
def on_receive(msg: Message):
    print(f"Received response for request ID {msg.request_id}: {msg.data.decode()}")

# Use the Client as a context manager for clean connection handling.
with Client(host='127.0.0.1', port=65432, on_receive=on_receive) as client:
    print("Client connected.")
    
    # Send an 'echo' request.
    request_id_1 = client.send('echo', b'Hello, World!')
    print(f"Sent 'echo' request with ID: {request_id_1}")
    
    time.sleep(1) # Wait for the response.
    
    # Send a 'ping' request.
    request_id_2 = client.send('ping', b'')
    print(f"Sent 'ping' request with ID: {request_id_2}")
    
    time.sleep(2) # Give time for messages to be processed before exiting.

print("Client disconnected.")
```

-----

### 3\. Asynchronous Example

#### Async Server (`async_server.py`)

```python
import asyncio
from bisocket import Server, ServerRequest

# Define an async handler for non-blocking operations.
async def ahandler(request: ServerRequest):
    print(f"Received method '{request.method}' with data: {request.data.decode()}")
    
    if request.method == 'echo':
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5) # Simulate I/O-bound work.
        request.send_data(request.data)

# Create and run the async server.
async def main():
    server = Server(host='127.0.0.1', port=65432, handler=ahandler)
    print("Starting asynchronous server on port 65432...")
    await server.astart()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Server shutting down.")
```

#### Async Client (`async_client.py`)

```python
import asyncio
from bisocket import Client, Message

# Define an async callback to process server messages.
async def aon_receive(msg: Message):
    print(f"Received response for request ID {msg.request_id}: {msg.data.decode()}")

async def main():
    # Use the async context manager for the client.
    async with Client(host='127.0.0.1', port=65432, on_receive=aon_receive) as client:
        print("Async client connected.")
        
        # Send multiple requests concurrently.
        tasks = [
            client.asend('echo', b'First async message'),
            client.asend('echo', b'Second async message')
        ]
        request_ids = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        print(f"Sent requests with IDs: {request_ids}")
        
        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Keep client running to receive responses.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## üß† How It Works

Traditional socket programming can be tricky when you need to send and receive data at the same time, often leading to blocking calls or complex multiplexing.

`bisocket` simplifies this by establishing **two separate socket connections** for each client:

1.  **Send Socket**: The client uses this connection exclusively to send data *to* the server.
2.  **Receive Socket**: The client uses this connection exclusively to receive data *from* the server.

This architecture allows the client and server to communicate in full-duplex mode without one operation blocking the other. The library manages these connections, message framing, encryption, and compression internally, so you can focus on your application logic.

  - **On the Client**: The `Client` runs a background thread (or `asyncio` task) to listen for incoming messages on the receive socket. These messages are passed to your `on_receive` callback.
  - **On the Server**: The `Server` manages a pool of client connections. It receives a request from a client's "send" socket, processes it in your handler, and then queues the response to be sent back via that same client's "receive" socket.

## üîê Security

All data transmitted by `bisocket` is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**, an authenticated encryption scheme that provides confidentiality and integrity. The 256-bit encryption key is derived from the string you provide via the `CRYPTO_KEY` environment variable using SHA-256.

**‚ö†Ô∏è It is crucial to set a strong, unique secret key for your application.**

You can generate a cryptographically secure key using OpenSSL:

```bash
# This command generates a 32-byte (256-bit) random key in hex format.
export CRYPTO_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

If `CRYPTO_KEY` is not set, a default, insecure key (`'secret-lol'`) is used, and a warning is printed. This is intended **only for local testing and development**.
