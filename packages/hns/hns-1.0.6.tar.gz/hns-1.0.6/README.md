# hns - A simple, privacy-focused speech-to-text CLI tool

A simple, privacy-focused speech-to-text CLI tool that records your voice, transcribes it locally using [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), and copies the transcription to your clipboard. Perfect for interacting with Claude Code, VS Code, Slack, or any application where native dictation falls short.

  ```

- **Note-Taking**: Quickly capture thoughts and ideas without switching from the keyboard.

## Installation

Install via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended):
```sh
uv tool install hns
```
or `pipx`:
```sh
pipx install hns
```
or `pip`:
```sh
pip install --user hns
```

The first time you run `hns`, it will download the default Whisper model (`base`). This requires an internet connection and may take a few moments. Subsequent runs can be fully offline.

## Usage

### Basic Transcription

1.  Run the command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    hns
    ```
2.  The tool will display `üé§ Recording...`. Speak into your microphone.
3.  Press `Enter` when you have finished.
4.  The transcribed text is automatically copied to your clipboard and printed to the console.

### Configuration

#### Listing Models

To see all available transcription models:
```sh
hns --list-models
```

#### Setting the Model

Select a model by setting the `HNS_WHISPER_MODEL` environment variable. The default is `base`. For higher accuracy, use a larger model like `medium` or `large-v3`.

```sh
# Use the 'small' model for the current session
export HNS_WHISPER_MODEL="small"
hns
```

To make the change permanent, add `export HNS_WHISPER_MODEL="<model_name>"` to your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.).

#### Setting the Language

By default, Whisper auto-detects the language. To force a specific language, set the `HNS_LANG` environment variable.

```sh
# Use an environment variable for Japanese
export HNS_LANG="ja"
hns
```
