# üîç Codetective - Multi-Agent Code Review Tool

A comprehensive code analysis tool that combines multiple scanning engines (SemGrep, Trivy, AI) with automated fixing capabilities using LangGraph orchestration.

# Why Codetective?

Modern codebases mix application logic, third‚Äëparty libraries, infrastructure as code, and configuration spread across many files and services. Traditional single‚Äëtool scanners catch some classes of issues but often miss others, and they rarely offer actionable fixes. Codetective approaches the problem as a coordinated, multi‚Äëagent system: specialized agents analyze code through different lenses (pattern‚Äëbased SAST, dependency and misconfiguration scanning, and AI‚Äëassisted review), while an orchestrator stitches their findings into a coherent story and can automatically suggest or apply improvements. The result is a practical workflow that not only detects problems, but also helps teams remediate them quickly.

In other words, Codetective is designed to be useful during day‚Äëto‚Äëday development and code review. It integrates cleanly into CLI and GUI flows, produces a standard JSON output you can consume in CI, and‚Äîwhen enabled‚Äîuses a local LLM to generate comments or edits that explain ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù to fix issues in context.

## Features

Codetective merges a few core ideas into one developer‚Äëfriendly workflow. It combines specialized agents (SemGrep, Trivy, and an AI reviewer) to surface issues from different angles, and it uses an orchestrator to sequence and aggregate results. In practice, you run a scan on your repository, review the unified findings, and optionally apply automated fixes or insert concise explanatory comments. Everything is available from the command line and a streamlined web interface.

Key capabilities include multi‚Äëagent scanning, automated fixing, a JSON results format for downstream tooling, and a configurable runtime that can execute agents sequentially or in parallel. The system is built to be practical: it can run with or without AI features, and it aims to provide explanations that are short enough to be helpful in code reviews.

}
```

## Agent Types

### Scan Agents

- **SemGrep Agent**: Static analysis using SemGrep rules
- **Trivy Agent**: Security vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning
- **AI Review Agent**: Intelligent code review using Ollama

### Output Agents

- **Comment Agent**: Generates concise TODO comments (under 100 words) for issues
  - Handles None/empty line numbers by adding comments at file beginning
  - Processes multiple issues in same file with proper line number tracking
  - Ignores existing comments when generating new explanations
- **Edit Agent**: Automatically applies code fixes
  - Focuses only on actual security vulnerabilities, not influenced by existing comments
  - Maintains original code structure and functionality

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

- **SemGrepAgent (`agents/scan/semgrep_agent.py`)**
  - Purpose: Pattern-based SAST scanning using community and registry rules.
  - Input: Project paths or files.
  - Output: `Issue` list with `rule_id`, `severity`, `file_path`, `line_number`, and optional autofix hint as `fix_suggestion`.
  - Strengths: Fast, broad language support, customizable rules. Great for secure coding patterns and known antipatterns.
  - Limitations: Rule-based (may miss logic flaws). Quality depends on rule set.

- **TrivyAgent (`agents/scan/trivy_agent.py`)**
  - Purpose: Detects vulnerabilities in dependencies, secrets, and misconfigurations across files and IaC.
  - Input: Paths (directories or files).
  - Output: `Issue` list synthesized from Trivy JSON: Vulnerabilities (`VulnerabilityID`), Secrets, and Misconfigurations.
  - Strengths: Broad coverage of OS packages, language deps, IaC; easy CI integration.
  - Limitations: Not a replacement for SAST logic analysis; complements Semgrep. See Trivy scope for details.

- **DynamicAIReviewAgent (`agents/scan/dynamic_ai_review_agent.py`)**
  - Purpose: LLM-driven code review with optional tool-use (web search) to reason about security and code quality.
  - Input: Supported source files (common languages), limited file count for performance.
  - Output: `Issue` entries summarizing key risks and recommendations (consolidated per file).
  - Strengths: Captures context-driven issues and best-practice gaps beyond rules.
  - Limitations: Requires Ollama running; response quality depends on model.

- **CommentAgent (`agents/output/comment_agent.py`)**
  - Purpose: Writes concise explanatory comments adjacent to problematic lines.
  - Input: Existing `Issue` list (from scan results).
  - Output: Updated `Issue` list (status remains detected/failed) and modified files (if applicable).
  - Notes: Preserves indentation, adapts comment style per file type, and supports backup files.

- **EditAgent (`agents/output/edit_agent.py`)**
  - Purpose: Generates and applies minimal, targeted fixes to code.
  - Input: Existing `Issue` list (from scan results).
  - Output: Updated `Issue` list with statuses (`FIXED`/`FAILED`) and list of modified files.
  - Strategy: Batches fixes to avoid context shifts; preserves structure/formatting.

## Reliability and Error Handling

Codetective is built to fail safely and keep you informed. The orchestrator in `core/orchestrator.py` records per‚Äëagent errors without halting the entire run: during sequential scans, `_run_all_agents()` wraps each agent in `try/except` and appends human‚Äëreadable messages to `error_messages`; during parallel scans, the `ThreadPoolExecutor` loop captures exceptions from futures and prints a clear note while still aggregating results from successful agents. This means a transient failure in, say, Trivy, won‚Äôt prevent SemGrep or the AI reviewer from completing.

External processes are executed through `utils/process_utils.py::run_command()`, which applies timeouts (configurable via `Config.agent_timeout`) and attempts graceful termination (`SIGTERM`) before forceful termination when supported by the OS. Output is always captured as text with replacement for invalid characters so logs remain readable. On timeout, the function returns a failed status with a descriptive message rather than raising, allowing upstream code to handle it predictably.

Agents check their own readiness. For example, `SemGrepAgent.is_available()` and `TrivyAgent.is_available()` verify tool availability via `utils/system_utils.py`; the AI‚Äëbased agents inherit from `agents/ai_base.py`, where `is_ai_available()` verifies Ollama connectivity and `call_ai()` centralizes error handling. When Ollama is unreachable, users see a specific, actionable error string (e.g., model not found, connection refused).

When modifying files, safety comes first. The `CommentAgent` and `EditAgent` can create backup files prior to changes and respect the `keep_backup` setting in `Config`. The comment agent formats annotations using the host language‚Äôs comment style, preserves indentation, and handles edge cases such as unknown line numbers by placing notes at the file head. The edit agent processes issues in stable batches to avoid line‚Äëshift hazards and writes back only when a meaningful change has been produced by the model.

Input scope is bounded to keep runs stable and fast. `utils/file_utils.py` validates paths, respects `.gitignore`, enforces maximum file size (`Config.max_file_size`), and allows inclusion/exclusion patterns, while `utils/git_utils.py` can focus on tracked or changed files. Together, they reduce noise and resource usage on large repositories.

Finally, results are standardized. Both scan and fix operations serialize their outputs (`models/schemas.py`) with timestamps, durations, and per‚Äëagent summaries. This makes failures auditable and performance measurable across runs, even when some agents are temporarily unavailable.

## Architecture

Codetective uses a multi-agent architecture orchestrated by LangGraph:
