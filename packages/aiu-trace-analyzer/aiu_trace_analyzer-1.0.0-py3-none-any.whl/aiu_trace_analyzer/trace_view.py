    Async events are used to specify asynchronous operations. e.g. frames in a game, or

    events from different processes and different threads.  Each async event has an
    additional required parameter id.  We consider the events with the same category and
    id as events from the same event tree. An optional scope string can be specified to
    avoid id conflicts, in which case we consider events with the same category, scope,
    and id as events from the same event tree. For instance, if we have an event, A, and
    its child event, B. Trace viewer will infer the parent-child relationship of A and B
    from the fact that event A and B have the same category and id, and the fact that Aâs
    start and end time pair encompasses that of B. When displayed, an entire async event
    chain will be drawn such that the parent will be the top slice, and its children are
    in rows beneath it. The root of the async event tree will be drawn as the top-most
    slice with a dark top border.

    Objects are a building block to track complex data structures in traces. Since traces
    go for long periods of time, the formative concept for this is a way to identify

    usually its pointer, e.g. id: "0x1000". But, in a long running trace, or just a trace
    with a clever allocator, a raw pointer 0x1000 might refer to two different objects at
    two different points in time. Object events do not have an args property associated
    with them.

    In the trace event format, we think in terms of object instances.  e.g. in C++, given
    class Foo , new Foo() at 0x1000 is an instance of Foo. There are three trace phase
    types associated with objects they are: N, O, and D, object created, object snapshot
    and object destroyed respectively.
