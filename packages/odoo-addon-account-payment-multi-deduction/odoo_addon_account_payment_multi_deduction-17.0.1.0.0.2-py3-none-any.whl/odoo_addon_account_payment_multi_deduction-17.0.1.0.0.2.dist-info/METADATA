This module extend invoice(s)'s register payment feature, from "Mark
invoice as fully paid" with a single writeoff amount, to "Mark invoice
as fully paid (multi deduct)" which allow multiple deduction amounts.

**Note:** We use the word "Deduction", as the diff amount can be
anything not only to writeoff.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
