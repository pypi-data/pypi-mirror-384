# PaIRS-UniNa: **Pa**rticle **I**mage **R**econstruction **S**oftware - **Uni**versity of **Na**ples "Federico II"
**PaIRS-UniNa** is a project developed by the Experimental Thermo Fluid-Dynamics (ETFD) group of University of Naples "Federico II" since 2000.
It is aimed to provide fast and efficient tools for digital particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis in research and industrial applications.

PaIRS-UniNa is based on a C library (**PaIRS-PIV**) and relies on a graphical user interface (**PaIRS**) that is developed via PySide6 and makes the use of PaIRS-PIV easy and intuitive.
PaIRS-PIV includes several modules that allow to process double-frame or time-resolved 2D planar PIV images as well as stereoscopic and tomographic PIV or Lagrangian particle tracking velocimetry (4D PTV) measurements.

The current release of PaIRS-UniNa features the module for the 2D planar PIV analysis and the stereoscopic PIV analysis and a module for optical calibration of camera systems, namely **CalVi**. 

CalVi is the calibration module of PaIRS-UniNa and allows accurate optical calibration of single and multiple camera bundles with the camera models mostly used in the PIV community: polynomials, rational functions and the pinhole camera model. Among the other features, it supports camera calibration procedures working with unknown positions and orientations of the calibration target and the integration of the pinhole camera model with a refractive correction model for cylindrical geometries (based on ray-tracing and Snell's law).

PaIRS-UniNa is supported by Python 3.10+ and is compatible with all the operating systems, however, the PaIRS-PIV library  relies on OpemMP library, which must be installed on the macOS platform. On the other side, PaIRS requires, among other packages, `SciPy` and `matplotlib`. 

For further information, please visit the [PaIRS website](https://www.pairs.unina.it/).

## What's new in PaIRS-UniNa 0.2.7

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed incorrect streamline visualization when viewing images in pixel units.  
- Reprojection errors in CalVi are now correctly recalculated and plotted when expanding the control-point grid.  
- Image transformations are now preserved even with automatic reshape/resize option enabled in the Output tab.  

### User-interface enhancements:
- The button for restricting the view on the interrogation-window area now opens a popup menu to select which interrogation-window size to display across process iterations.  
- Duplicated process names are automatically updated to avoid conflicts.  
- Improved behavior of editable fields: accurate cursor positioning, proper highlighting and background restoration.  

### Distribution:
- ready-to-use executables of PaIRS are now available!

## Portable executable
Download the standalone PaIRS_UniNa executable from the [PaIRS website](https://www.pairs.unina.it/#download).

## Installation in Python
All PaIRS-UniNa wheels are distributed under LGPLv3+ licences. The installation can be performed with:
```
python -m pip install PaIRS-UniNa
```
### MacOS requirements
Normally the OpenMP library is not preinstalled in MacOs. A possible way to install this library is:
```
curl -O https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/openmp-12.0.1-darwin20-Release.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz openmp-12.0.1-darwin20-Release.tar.gz -C /
```

## Run 
### From command prompt (Python package)
It is possible to run PaIRS directly from the command prompt with:
```
python -m PaIRS_UniNa
```
PaIRS automatically saves and stores its configuration upon exit and starts from the latter at the next run. If any trouble with loading the last configuration file (saved in the package folder) occurs, the user is suggested to execute a clean run of PaIRS via the following command:
```
python -m PaIRS_UniNa -c
```
A debug mode is also available for developers. It can be accessed via:
```
python -m PaIRS_UniNa -d
```
After the above command, the user will be asked to enter a password. Interested users can ask the password to the authors by sending an email to: etfd@unina.it. The debug mode can be turned on/off at any time via the keyboard sequence: Alt+Shift+D.
 
On macOS and Linux ```python``` must be replaced by ```python3```.

### From command prompt (executable version)
The same options are also available when using the portable/executable version of PaIRS. From the command prompt you can simply run:
```
PaIRS -c      (Windows)
./PaIRS -c    (MacOS/Linux)
```
to perform a clean run, or:
```
PaIRS -d      (Windows)
./PaIRS -d    (MacOS/Linux)
```
to start in debug mode (password required).

### In Python environment
In a Python environment, to run PaIRS the following commands can be used :
```
>>> from PaIRS_UniNa import PaIRS
>>> PaIRS.run()
```
For clean mode:
```
>>> PaIRS.cleanRun()
```
while for debug mode:
```
>>> PaIRS.debugRun()
```
