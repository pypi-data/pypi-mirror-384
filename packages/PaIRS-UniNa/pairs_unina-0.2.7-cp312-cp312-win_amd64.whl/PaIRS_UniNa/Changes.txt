*********   Changes in version 0.2.7 (2025.10.13)  **********
Bug fixes:
- resolved an issue related to visulazion of streamlines when the image is shown in pixel units and a custom resolution is specified (in previous versions, streamlines were always represented in physical units);
- corrected the update of reprojection errors in CalVi when the control point grid is expanded after a calibration. Each new control point now has its error recalculated and plotted, providing a correct view of the extrapolation error;
- fixed the automatic resize/reshape behavior specified in the Output tab: when an image transformation is assigned, it is now preserved even if the automatic reshape button is active.

User-interface enhancements:
- changed the behavior of the Vis button for restricting view on the interrogation window area: clicking it now opens a popup menu that allows users to select the desired interrogation-window size to focus on among all iterations of the process;
- names of processes duplicated in the process tree are now automatically updated to avoid conflicts: if a name already exists, the new one is appended with an incremental suffix;
- improved interaction with editable input fields: when hovering the highlighted style is displayed correctly, the text cursor now appears exactly where clicked and the background color is properly restored when leaving the field.

*********   Changes in version 0.2.4 (2024.12.01)  **********
Bug fixes:
- fixed critical bugs in process handling and calibration step (CalVi usage, closing PaIRS during CalVi operation, resetting steps while running);
- resolved issues with velocity field visualization and stereo-PIV streamline representation;  
- fixed undo/redo functionality, image tree selection issues, logging errors and focus-out signal handling.

New features:
- extended Vis features, including reference frame system plotting and vorticity field visualization;
- introduced the ability to copy input and output information from other steps within the same process;
- introduced functionality to interrupt processing before it starts if issues are detected.

Performance improvements:

- streamlined process workflows, including faster and more reliable parameter updates.

User-interface enhancements:

*********   Changes in version 0.2.3 (2024.11.06)  **********
- Fixed bug in the functionality for replicating processes with changed input folders introduced in version v0.2.2.

- Fixed bug in the compatibility check for the common region in disparity and stereoscopic PIV analysis steps.



*********   Changes in version 0.2.2 (2024.10.15)  **********
- [!!! Critical !!!] Fixed critical errors in the calculation of Reynolds stresses for stereoscopic PIV processes. Please consider reviewing the results from processes executed with version 0.2.1, as the w'w', u'w', and v'w' stresses were incorrectly calculated.

- Introduced the "Laser Equation Plane" box in the Output tab to specify the initial attempt in the disparity step or to independently assign the constant values of the laser plane during the stereoscopic PIV step.

- Introduced the "Copy process to loop over folders" button in the process tree. The latter allows the user to select multiple folders from the disk and replicate the process in the tree for each folder, automatically updating the input image path (specified in the Input tab) to match the path of each selected folder. This makes it extremely easy and fast to create a queue of processes for folders containing similar image sets.

- Resolved various bugs related to the copy and link functions of steps within the process tree. Buttons have been relocated to the Explorer, and additional functionality has been added to the context menu of the process tree items.

- Improved stability and interface performance.

- The guide of PaIRS-UniNa v0.2 is now available. Discover all the information you need for advanced software usage at https://www.pairs.unina.it/web/PaIRS-UniNa-v020-Guide.pdf.



*********   Changes in version 0.2.1 (2024.07.08)  **********
- Fixed bugs for Python 3.11 and 3.12.

- Fixed minor bugs.



**********   Changes in 0.2.0 (2024.07.03)  **********
- The latest version of PaIRS marks a departure from its predecessors. PaIRS now boasts a completely redesigned interface aimed at quick, simple, and efficient usability. Users bid farewell to Past, Present, and Future trees in favor of a new, more intuitive process management system (the Explorer): processes are organized into groups called projects and each project or process can be queued for later execution. Processes within each project can be modified until they are launched, and if necessary, reset and restarted from scratch. Each project also features a tree of deleted processes, allowing retrieval of outdated or abandoned processes.

- Currently, PaIRS includes four types of processes: preprocessing, PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry), calibration, and stereoscopic PIV. Each of these processes consists of one or more steps, which can be optional or mandatory. Similar to the first version of PaIRS, these steps are editable via PaIRS iconic tabs (Input, Output, Process, etc.). The process tree provides immediate visibility into the status of each step, further streamlining management.

- The calibration process grants access to CalVi (Calibration Visualizer). It is no longer necessary to launch the PaIRS calibration tool separately; everything is conveniently available within a single interface.

- The Input tab introduces a completely renewed image import list, offering users total freedom without the constraints of the past.

- Additionally, the Vis tab introduces some exciting new features, such as the ability to modify colormaps and vector/streamline colors, along with improved handling of image/result loading.



**********   Changes in version 0.1.13 (2024.02.07)  **********
- Fixed bugs related to navigation across the Past, Present and Future trees in the Queue tab.

- Minor changes in Vis.



**********   Changes in version 0.1.12 (2024.02.02)  **********
- PaIRS now includes the possibility to customize the windowing parameters for each iteration of a PIV process. The user can choose the windowing parameters for each iteration in the initial phase of the PIV process. This is possible by operating in the Windowing box at the bottom of the Process tab (visible only in the expert mode). A table widget has been added to this section, where the user can find all relevant information the windowing scheme for the PIV process and modify it iteration by iteration. By selecting the corresponding row of the table, the user can choose for the current iteration the type of weighting window to be used in the calculation of the absolute velocity and in the determination of the correlation map, if using the direct correlations or not and the maximum displacement allowed in the interrogation window. The latter parameter is an innovation of the present version itself and adds to the custom settings selectable by the user to build affordable validation strategies. In addition, in the table an indication about the stability of the windowing scheme for each iteration is reported. In conclusion, a larger degree of customization of the PIV process comes with the present modification of PaIRS.
 
- CalVi now fully supports optical camera calibration for transparent cylindrical geometries. In the version 0.1.10 this camera model was available only in debug mode for beta testers and developers, now it is fully working. The calibration of this camera model is however a delicate task and the user is referred to the CalVi guide for reliable experimental procedures that could be used in this direction.

- PaIRS and CalVi now checks for new releases of the PaIRS-UniNa package and if a new version is found online, a notification is shown. The users are warmly recommended to stay up-to-date with the latest issues of PaIRS-UniNa!

Minor changes:
- It is now possible to import previously obtained calibration results in CalVi. This saves considerable time by avoiding the initial phase of search of the control points in the different target images used for the calibration process.

- It is now possible to launch new instances of PaIRS and CalVi from a specific menu in the Menu bar of both the software applications.

- In the Import tab, the previously selected paths are now stored and suggested to the user while typing in the corresponding edit box.

- Minor bugs solved.
