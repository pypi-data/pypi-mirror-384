    "Optimal control solvers often need to compute a search direction and try it along a step length. These computations are performed by Crocoddyl's `calc` and `calcDiff` functions. Concretely, these functions update the information of:\n",

    " $$\\delta\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{f}(\\delta\\mathbf{x}_k,\\mathbf{u}_k)$$\n",

    " $$\\mathbf{\\ell_x}, \\mathbf{\\ell_u}, \\mathbf{\\ell_{xx}}, \\mathbf{\\ell_{ux}}, \\mathbf{\\ell_{uu}} \\hspace{1em} (cost)$$\n",
    " \n",
    "To optimize the performance of the solver, Crocoddyl stores all relevant information inside **data** objects. This approach avoids dynamic memory reallocation during the calculations, which helps to speed up the process, especially when the solver is called iteratively in the optimization process. Creating each data object is done via `createData`.\n",
