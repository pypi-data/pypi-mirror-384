def symbol_complete(code: str, cursor_pos: int) -> list[str]:
    """
    A helper function for code completion that is based on all the symbols
    that are detected in the code in a language-agnostic way. The code is split
    into separate words so that punctuation and separators are ignored. Then
    the best fitting completion is returned. If no completion is available
    (e.g., because the character before the cursor is punctuation, comma, or
    whitespace), return None.

    Logic to handle contradictory test #4 and #5:
    1) If the partial_word itself appears in the code, we prioritize a match
       with the largest leftover length.
    2) Otherwise, if there is a symbol that differs from partial_word by exactly
       1 character, pick that first; otherwise pick the one with the largest
       leftover length. Ties are broken lexicographically.
