class SmartBackspaceDelete:
    """
    This is meant to be used as a mixin for QPlainTextEdit to enhance the
    functionality of backspace and delete in a code editor. It re-implements
    keyPressEvent(), supporting the following behavior:

    1) Backspace anywhere in the whitespace at the end of a line:
       - Full right-trim of the whitespace for that line (including whitespace
         before the cursor).
       - Place the cursor at the end of the trimmed line.
    2) Backspace at the very start of a line:
       - Delete the preceding newline and trailing whitespace on the previous
         line (up to the first non-whitespace or newline).
       - Place the cursor at the end of the trimmed preceding line.
    3) Delete anywhere in the whitespace at the end of a line (except the
       very last position):
       - Right-trim from the cursor position onward.
       - The cursor does not move, so it can remain at the same block/column
         index once the whitespace is removed.
    4) Delete at the very end of a line:
       - Delete the next newline and the leading whitespace on the next line
         up to the first non-whitespace or newline.
       - Keep the cursor where it was, effectively pulling up the next line.
