"""This module implements a watchdog that ensures that subprocess are killed
when the main process is no longer alive. It does so by starting a separate
watchdog process that occasionally checks whether the main process is still
alive.

To handle unexpected crashes of the application, it periodically checks whether
the main process is still alive. When the main process has died, it first kills
all registerd subprocesses, and then shuts itself down. 

To handle clean application exist, it also listens for an explicit shutdown
signal, in which case it does the same.

In all cases, the watchdog should make sure that no subprocesses, including 
itself, stay alive after the main process has died.
