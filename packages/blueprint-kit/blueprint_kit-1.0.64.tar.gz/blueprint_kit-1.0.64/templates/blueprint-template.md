# [ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT NAME]

## Architecture Overview
**What**: [Brief description of the architectural approach]

**Why**: [Reason for choosing this architecture and its benefits]

**Context**: [System context and constraints that influence this architecture]

## Core Components
- [Component 1]: [Description and responsibilities]
- [Component 2]: [Description and responsibilities]
- [Component 3]: [Description and responsibilities]

## System Design
### Architecture Pattern
- [Primary architectural pattern being used (e.g., microservices, layered, event-driven)]

### Technology Stack
- [Framework/Platform]: [Specific technology and version]
- [Database]: [Specific database technology]
- [Communication]: [How components communicate]
- [Security]: [How security is implemented]

### Data Flow
- [Description of how data moves through the system]

## Interface Design
### APIs
- [API types and their purposes]
- [API versioning strategy]

### External Dependencies
- [List of external services or systems the architecture depends on]

## Deployment Architecture
- [How the system will be deployed]
- [Infrastructure requirements]
- [Scalability considerations]

## Quality Attributes
- [Performance]: [Performance requirements and expectations]
- [Security]: [Security requirements and measures]
- [Scalability]: [How the system handles growth]
- [Maintainability]: [How easy the system is to maintain]

## Constraints & Decisions
- [Technical constraints that influence this blueprint]
- [Key architectural decisions made and rationale]

## Risks & Mitigations
- [Potential risks with this architecture]
- [How these risks will be mitigated]

## Artifact Synchronization
### Keeping Related Artifacts Updated
- [ ] Ensure `spec.md` reflects any architectural constraints that affect requirements
- [ ] Update `goals.md` if architecture affects measurable outcomes or success metrics
- [ ] Align with `plan.md` to ensure implementation approach matches architectural blueprint
- [ ] Coordinate with `tasks.md` to ensure tasks reflect architectural components

### Architecture Evolution Tracking
- [How will architectural decisions made during implementation be captured?]
- [Process for updating blueprint if architecture changes during development]
