**Responsibilities**:
- Identify complex unclear areas in enterprise specifications, goals, and blueprints
- Generate targeted questions to resolve strategic ambiguities
- Help stakeholders provide necessary clarifications for enterprise-level decisions
- Ensure project readiness for the planning phase with advanced requirements clarity
- Conduct advanced business analysis and requirements engineering

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/blueprint.clarify` in the triggering message **is** the clarification directive. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that clarification directive, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for FEATURE_DIR. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.

2. Load `.blueprint/specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/spec.md` to understand feature requirements.

3. Load `.blueprint/specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/goals.md` to understand measurable outcomes.

4. Load `.blueprint/specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/blueprint.md` to understand architectural approach.

5. If any required file is missing, ERROR with specific file name that's missing.

6. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: Use default clarification approach
    2. Analyze spec.md for underspecified areas
       - Identify [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
       - Find ambiguous requirements
       - Check for missing edge cases
    3. Analyze goals.md for unclear metrics
       - Identify vague success criteria
       - Check for measurable but unclear outcomes
    4. Analyze blueprint.md for architectural gaps
       - Identify underspecified components
       - Check for unclear technology choices
    5. Generate targeted questions based on analysis
       - Focus on areas that could cause implementation issues
       - Prioritize by impact on scope, security, performance
    6. Present questions to user in structured format
    7. Update artifacts with user responses
    8. Return: SUCCESS (clarifications resolved)

7. Identify areas needing clarification across all three artifacts:

   a. **From spec.md**:
      - Requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
      - Ambiguous user scenarios
      - Unclear acceptance criteria
      - Undefined edge cases
      - Missing constraints or assumptions
   
   b. **From goals.md**:
      - Vague success metrics
      - Unclear timeline constraints
      - Undefined stakeholder expectations
      - Unmeasurable outcomes
   
   c. **From blueprint.md**:
      - Undefined architectural components
      - Unclear technology choices
      - Vague quality attributes
      - Undefined deployment considerations

8. Present clarification questions in this format:

   ```markdown
   ## Question [N]: [Topic]
   
   **Context**: [Quote relevant section from artifact]
   
   **What we need to know**: [Specific clarification needed]
   
   **Suggested Answers**:
   
   | Option | Answer | Implications |
   |--------|--------|--------------|
   | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
   | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
   | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
   | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
   
   **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
   ```

9. **Critical formatting requirements**:
   - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned in tables
   - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
   - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
   - Test that tables render correctly in markdown preview
   - Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, etc.)

10. Wait for user responses and update the relevant artifacts:
    - Update `.blueprint/specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/spec.md` with resolved clarifications
    - Update `.blueprint/specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/goals.md` with clarified metrics
    - Update `.blueprint/specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/blueprint.md` with architectural decisions

11. Report completion with updated artifacts and readiness for the next phase (`/blueprint.plan`).

**NOTE:** The script validates that spec.md, goals.md and blueprint.md exist before starting clarification.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **RESOLVING AMBIGUITY** across all artifacts.
- Clarify areas that could cause implementation issues.
- Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security > performance > user experience.
- Written for stakeholders who need to provide clarification.
- Limit to maximum 3 questions per artifact to avoid overwhelming user.

## Decision-Making Hierarchy for Ambiguous Situations

When determining what needs clarification, use this hierarchy to make decisions:

1. **Default to risk mitigation** - When ambiguity exists, prioritize clarification of areas that pose the highest project risk

2. **Preserve project scope** - Focus on clarifications that prevent scope creep or ensure scope clarity

3. **Prioritize implementation blockers** - Address ambiguities that would prevent implementation first

4. **Follow stakeholder impact** - Clarify items that have the greatest impact on success metrics

5. **Document assumptions** - Clearly mark any decisions made using default options with [ASSUMPTION: brief explanation] markers

## Error Handling and Validation

1. **Before identifying clarifications**: Verify all required artifacts exist and are accessible
2. **During identification**: Validate that each clarification request addresses a genuine ambiguity or risk
3. **After generating questions**: Confirm questions are specific and actionable
4. **File operations**: Always update the appropriate artifact files after receiving user responses (never create new files) and validate files exist before updating

### Clarification Requirements

- **Scope Impact**: Clarify areas that significantly impact feature scope
- **Risk Reduction**: Address areas with potential security, performance, or architectural risks
- **Implementation Readiness**: Resolve issues that could block implementation
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all key requirements are clearly understood

### For AI Generation

When identifying areas for clarification:

1. **Be Specific**: Ask about specific sections of artifacts
2. **Provide Options**: Suggest 2-3 viable answers for each question
3. **Explain Implications**: Describe what each option means for the feature
4. **Focus on Risks**: Prioritize areas that could cause implementation or architectural issues
5. **Keep Questions Short**: Limit questions to maximum 3 per artifact type
6. **Validate Readiness**: Ensure clarification will prepare for the planning phase

**Clarification Best Practices**:

- Address scope-changing ambiguities first
- Clarify security or compliance requirements early
- Resolve architectural approach questions before planning
- Focus on questions where the AI cannot reasonably guess
