# [GOAL NAME]

## Goal Definition
**What**: [Clear, specific description of what needs to be achieved]

**Why**: [Business justification and expected impact]

**Success Metrics**: [Quantifiable measures of goal success]

## Success Criteria
- [Specific, measurable conditions that define success]
- [Each criterion should be verifiable and time-bound if possible]

## Key Stakeholders
- [List of people impacted by or involved in achieving this goal]

## Timeline
- [High-level timeline with key phases and milestones]

## Constraints & Assumptions
- [Any limitations, dependencies, or assumptions that apply]

## Success Indicators
- [How will we measure and validate that the goal has been achieved?]
- [What data or metrics will we use?]

## Validation Approach
- [How will we verify that success criteria have been met?]

## Goal Evolution Tracking
### Keeping Related Artifacts Updated
- [ ] Update `spec.md` if measurable outcomes require specification changes
- [ ] Coordinate with `blueprint.md` to ensure architecture supports updated goals
- [ ] Align with `plan.md` to ensure implementation approach matches updated goals
- [ ] Update `tasks.md` when success criteria change

### Goal Feedback Loop
- [How will progress toward goals affect specifications or architecture?]
- [Process for refining goals based on implementation learnings]
