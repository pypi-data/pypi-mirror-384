The archetypes themselves are restricted to being mixtures of the individuals in the data set. Archetypes are selected by minimizing the squared error in representing each individual as a mixture of archetypes. The usefulness of archetypal analysis is illustrated on several data sets. Computing the archetypes is a nonlinear least squares problem, which is solved using an alternating minimizing algorithm.},

  abstract = {Managing Trade-Offs                            Most organisms experience selection on a host of traits to determine their likelihood to succeed evolutionarily. However, specific traits may experience trade-offs in determining an organism's optimal phenotype.                                Shoval                 et al.

The results suggest how selection makes the best trade-offs for an arbitrary number of tasks and traits and may explain examples of evolutionary variation.                        ,              The fitness of an organism can be modeled graphically to determine how phenotypic trade-offs are maximized.           ,              Biological systems that perform multiple tasks face a fundamental trade-off: A given phenotype cannot be optimal at all tasks. Here we ask how trade-offs affect the range of phenotypes found in nature. Using the Pareto front concept from economics and engineering, we find that best–trade-off phenotypes are weighted averages of archetypes—phenotypes specialized for single tasks. For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin’s finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.},

  abstract = {There is a revolution in the ability to analyze gene expression of single cells in a tissue. To understand this data we must comprehend how cells are distributed in a high-dimensional gene expression space. One open question is whether cell types form discrete clusters or whether gene expression forms a continuum of states. If such a continuum exists, what is its geometry? Recent theory on evolutionary trade-offs suggests that cells that need to perform multiple tasks are arranged in a polygon or polyhedron (line, triangle, tetrahedron and so on, generally called polytopes) in gene expression space, whose vertices are the expression profiles optimal for each task. Here, we analyze single-cell data from human and mouse tissues profiled using a variety of single-cell technologies. We fit the data to shapes with different numbers of vertices, compute their statistical significance, and infer their tasks. We find cases in which single cells fill out a continuum of expression states within a polyhedron. This occurs in intestinal progenitor cells, which fill out a tetrahedron in gene expression space. The four vertices of this tetrahedron are each enriched with genes for a specific task related to stemness and early differentiation. A polyhedral continuum of states is also found in spleen dendritic cells, known to perform multiple immune tasks: cells fill out a tetrahedron whose vertices correspond to key tasks related to maturation, pathogen sensing and communication with lymphocytes. A mixture of continuum-like distributions and discrete clusters is found in other cell types, including bone marrow and differentiated intestinal crypt cells. This approach can be used to understand the geometry and biological tasks of a wide range of single-cell datasets. The present results suggest that the concept of cell type may be expanded. In addition to discreet clusters in gene-expression space, we suggest a new possibility: a continuum of states within a polyhedron, in which the vertices represent specialists at key tasks.},

  abstract = {Single-cell gene expression reveals the diversity within a differentiated cell type. Often, cells of the same type show a continuum of gene-expression patterns. The origin of such continuum gene-expression patterns is unclear. To address this, we develop a theory to understand how a continuum provides division of labor in a tissue in which cells collectively contribute to several tasks. We find that a continuum is optimal when there are spatial gradients in the tissue that affect the performance in each task. The continuum is bounded inside a polyhedron whose vertices are expression profiles optimal at each task. We test this using single-cell gene expression for intestinal villi and liver hepatocytes, which form a curved 1D trajectory and a full 3D tetrahedron in gene-expression space, respectively. We infer the tasks for both cell types and characterize the spatial zonation of the task-specialist cells. This approach can be generally applied to other tissues.},

  abstract = {Most cell types in multicellular organisms can perform multiple functions. However, not all functions can be optimally performed simultaneously by the same cells. Functions incompatible at the level of individual cells can be performed at the cell population level, where cells divide labor and specialize in different functions. Division of labor can arise due to instruction by tissue environment or through self-organization. Here, we develop a computational framework to investigate the contribution of these mechanisms to division of labor within a cell-type population. By optimizing collective cellular task performance under trade-offs, we find that distinguishable expression patterns can emerge from cell-cell interactions versus instructive signals. We propose a method to construct ligand-receptor networks between specialist cells and use it to infer division-oflabor mechanisms from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data of stromal, epithelial, and immune cells. Our framework can be used to characterize the complexity of cell interactions within tissues.},

Single-cell approaches are necessary to study this process, given the spatial heterogeneity of liver cell types. Here, we use spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the dynamics of mouse liver regeneration after acute acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication. We find that hepatocytes proliferate throughout the liver lobule, creating the mitotic pressure required to repopulate the necrotic pericentral zone rapidly. A subset of hepatocytes located at the regenerating front transiently upregulate fetal-specific genes, including Afp and Cdh17, as they reprogram to a pericentral state. Zonated endothelial, hepatic stellate cell (HSC), and macrophage populations are differentially involved in immune recruitment, proliferation, and matrix remodeling. We observe massive transient infiltration of myeloid cells, yet stability of lymphoid cell abundance, in accordance with a global decline in antigen presentation. Our study provides a resource for understanding the coordinated programs of zonal liver regeneration.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization is performed to identify several landmark genes in the liver and their level of expression in single-cell RNA sequencing is used to spatially reconstruct the zonation of all liver genes. A few important liver genes are differentially expressed in a radial fashion from the central vein outward, but the extent of such spatial division, or zonation, has remained unknown. Shalev Itzkovitz, Ido Amit and colleagues performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization against several landmark genes, and used their level of expression to spatially reconstruct the zonation of all liver genes. They find that around half of the genes in the liver are zonated, and surprisingly also find that several genes peak in the middle of the liver lobules. The succession of gene expression profiles matches the position of proteins in the bile-acid biosynthetic cascade. The mammalian liver consists of hexagon-shaped lobules that are radially polarized by blood flow and morphogens1,2,3,4. Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation5,6, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization7. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that around 50\% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.},

Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for a rigorous interpretation of cell states and do not utilize associated histology images. Significant sample variation further complicates the integration of ST datasets, which is essential for identifying commonalities across tissues or altered cellular wiring in disease. Here, we present Starfysh, the first comprehensive computational toolbox for joint modeling of ST and histology data, dissection of refined cell states, and systematic integration of multiple ST datasets from complex tissues. Starfysh uses an auxiliary deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell state markers to avoid the need for a single-cell-resolution reference in characterizing known or novel tissue-specific cell states. Additionally, Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues by leveraging histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial “hubs” across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor-positive (ER             +             ) breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tumors using Starfysh led to the identification of heterogeneous patient- and disease-specific hubs as well as a shared stromal hub with varying spatial orientation. Our results show the ability to delineate the spatial co-evolution of tumor and immune cell states and their crosstalk underlying intratumoral heterogeneity in TNBC and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.

As such AA favors features that constitute representative ‘corners’ of the data, i.e., distinct aspects or archetypes. We currently show that AA enjoys the interpretability of clustering –without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of SVD – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale AA, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote FURTHESTSUM that is inspired by the FURTHESTFIRST approach widely used for K-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the AA procedure to KERNEL-AA in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of AA when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the AA model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data. Matlab code for the derived algorithms is available for download from www.mortenmorup.dk.},

Here we propose a complex systems theory perspective to address this fundamental gap in our understanding of tissue biology. We introduce the concept of cell categories, which is based on cell relations rather than cell identity. Based on these notions we then discuss common principles of tissue modularity, introducing compositional, structural, and functional tissue modules.

  abstract = {Abstract             Dissecting the cellular heterogeneity embedded in single-cell transcriptomic data is challenging. Although many methods and approaches exist, identifying cell states and their underlying topology is still a major challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of multiresolution cell-state decomposition as a practical approach to simultaneously capture both fine- and coarse-grain patterns of variability. We implement this concept in ACTIONet, a comprehensive framework that combines archetypal analysis and manifold learning to provide a ready-to-use analytical approach for multiresolution single-cell state characterization. ACTIONet provides a robust, reproducible, and highly interpretable single-cell analysis platform that couples dominant pattern discovery with a corresponding structural representation of the cell state landscape. Using multiple synthetic and real data sets, we demonstrate ACTIONet’s superior performance relative to existing alternatives. We use ACTIONet to integrate and annotate cells across three human cortex data sets. Through integrative comparative analysis, we define a consensus vocabulary and a consistent set of gene signatures discriminating against the transcriptomic cell types and subtypes of the human prefrontal cortex.},

This leads to a combinatorial challenge in (a) summarizing the cellular and phenotypic architecture of tissues and (b) identifying phenotypes with interesting spatial architecture. To address this, we combine ideas from community ecology and machine learning into niche-phenotype mapping (NIPMAP). NIPMAP takes advantage of geometric constraints on local cellular composition imposed by the niche structure of tissues in order to automatically segment tissue sections into niches and their interfaces. Projecting phenotypes on niches and their interfaces identifies previously-reported and previously-unreported spatially-driven phenotypes, concisely summarizes the phenotypic architecture of tissues, and reveals fundamental properties of tissue architecture. NIPMAP is applicable to both protein and RNA multiplex histology of healthy and diseased tissue. An open-source R/Python package implements NIPMAP.},

One major challenge that limits the applicability of AA in practice is the inherent computational complexity of the existing algorithms. In this paper, we provide a novel approximation approach to partially address this issue. Utilizing probabilistic ideas from high-dimensional geometry, we introduce two preprocessing techniques to reduce the dimension and representation cardinality of the data, respectively. We prove that provided data are approximately embedded in a low-dimensional linear subspace and the convex hull of the corresponding representations is well approximated by a polytope with a few vertices, our method can effectively reduce the scaling of AA. Moreover, the solution of the reduced problem is near-optimal in terms of prediction errors. Our approach can be combined with other acceleration techniques to further mitigate the intrinsic complexity of AA. We demonstrate the usefulness of our results by applying our method to summarize several moderately large-scale datasets.},

We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells.

We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations.

  abstract = {All transplanted kidneys are subjected to some degree of injury as a result of the donation-implantation process and various post-transplant stresses such as rejection. Because transplants are frequently biopsied, they present an opportunity to explore the full spectrum of kidney response-to-wounding from all causes. Defining parenchymal damage in transplanted organs is important for clinical management because it determines function and survival. In this study, we classified the scenarios associated with parenchymal injury in genome-wide microarray results from 1,526 kidney transplant indication biopsies collected during the INTERCOMEX study. We defined injury groups by using archetypal analysis (AA) of scores for gene sets and classifiers previously identified in various injury states. Six groups and their characteristics were defined in this population: No injury, minor injury, two classes of acute kidney injury (“AKI,” AKI1, and AKI2), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD combined with AKI. We compared the two classes of AKI, namely, AKI1 and AKI2. AKI1 had a poor function and increased parenchymal dedifferentiation but minimal response-to-injury and inflammation, instead having increased expression of PARD3, a gene previously characterized as being related to epithelial polarity and adherens junctions. In contrast, AKI2 had a poor function and increased response-to-injury, significant inflammation, and increased macrophage activity. In random forest analysis, the most important predictors of function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and graft loss were injury-based molecular scores, not rejection scores. AKI1 and AKI2 differed in 3-year graft survival, with better survival in the AKI2 group. Thus, injury archetype analysis of injury-induced gene expression shows new heterogeneity in kidney response-to-wounding, revealing AKI1, a class of early transplants with a poor function but minimal inflammation or response to injury, a deviant response characterized as PC3, and an increased risk of failure. Given the relationship between parenchymal injury and kidney survival, further characterization of the injury phenotypes in kidney transplants will be important for an improved understanding that could have implications for understanding native kidney diseases (               ClinicalTrials.gov               \#NCT01299168).},

To understand the selection of factors driving heterogeneity before and through adaptation to treatment, we profile single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) transcriptomes of HGSOC tumors collected longitudinally during therapy. We analyze scRNA-seq data from two independent patient cohorts to reveal that HGSOC is driven by three archetypal phenotypes, defined as oncogenic states that describe the majority of the transcriptome variation. Using a multi-task learning approach to identify the biological tasks of each archetype, we identify metabolism and proliferation, cellular defense response, and DNA repair signaling as consistent cell states found across patients. Our analysis demonstrates a shift in favor of the metabolism and proliferation archetype versus cellular defense response archetype in cancer cells that received multiple lines of treatment. While archetypes are not consistently associated with specific whole-genome driver mutations, they are closely associated with subclonal populations at the single-cell level, indicating that subclones within a tumor often specialize in unique biological tasks. Our study reveals the core archetypes found in progressive HGSOC and shows consistent enrichment of subclones with the metabolism and proliferation archetype as resistance is acquired to multiple lines of therapy.},

The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real–valued. This, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal soccer players based on performance data, archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.},

  abstract = {Archetypal analysis is a matrix factorization method with convexity constraints. Due to local minima, a good initialization is essential, but frequently used initialization methods yield either sub-optimal starting points or are prone to get stuck in poor local minima. In this paper, we propose archetypal analysis++ (AA++), a probabilistic initialization strategy for archetypal analysis that sequentially samples points based on their influence on the objective function, similar to k-means++. In fact, we argue that k-means++ already approximates the proposed initialization method. Furthermore, we suggest to adapt an efficient Monte Carlo approximation of k-means++ to AA++. In an extensive empirical evaluation of 15 real-world data sets of varying sizes and dimensionalities and considering two pre-processing strategies, we show that AA++ almost always outperforms all baselines, including the most frequently used ones.},

  abstract = {The estimation of genetic clusters using genomic data has application from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to demographic history to polygenic risk scores (PRS) and is expected to play an important role in the analyses of increasingly diverse, large-scale cohorts. However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.},

  abstract = {Archetypes represent extreme manifestations of a population with respect to specific characteristic traits or features. In linear feature space, archetypes approximate the data convex hull allowing all data points to be expressed as convex mixtures of archetypes. As mixing of archetypes is performed directly on the input data, linear Archetypal Analysis requires additivity of the input, which is a strong assumption unlikely to hold e.g. in case of image data. To address this problem, we propose learning an appropriate latent feature space while simultaneously identifying suitable archetypes. We thus introduce a generative formulation of the linear archetype model, parameterized by neural networks. By introducing the distance-dependent archetype loss, the linear archetype model can be integrated into the latent space of a deep variational information bottleneck and an optimal representation, together with the archetypes, can be learned end-to-end. Moreover, the information bottleneck framework allows for a natural incorporation of arbitrarily complex side information during training. As a consequence, learned archetypes become easily interpretable as they derive their meaning directly from the included side information. Applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by exploring archetypes of female facial expressions while using multi-rater based emotion scores of these expressions as side information. A second application illustrates the exploration of the chemical space of small organic molecules. By using different kinds of side information we demonstrate how identified archetypes, along with their interpretation, largely depend on the side information provided.},

Although single-cell analyses provided insights into cytopathology, evolving cellular processes underlying MS remain poorly understood. We investigated the cellular dynamics of MS by modeling temporal and regional rates of disease progression in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). By performing single-cell spatial expression profiling using in situ sequencing (ISS), we annotated disease neighborhoods and found centrifugal evolution of active lesions. We demonstrated that disease-associated (DA)-glia arise independently of lesions and are dynamically induced and resolved over the disease course. Single-cell spatial mapping of human archival MS spinal cords confirmed the differential distribution of homeostatic and DA-glia, enabled deconvolution of active and inactive lesions into sub-compartments, and identified new lesion areas. By establishing a spatial resource of mouse and human MS neuropathology at a single-cell resolution, our study unveils the intricate cellular dynamics underlying MS.},

Cell type–specific expression features predicted case-control status and stratified patients into two molecular subtypes.

On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},

Empirically, we show that the coresets lead to improved performance on several data sets.},

Here, we introduce a framework that combines archetypal analysis, an approach grounded in biological principles, with deep learning. Using archetypes based on evolutionary trade-offs and Pareto optimality, MIDAA finds extreme data points that define the geometry of the latent space, preserving the complexity of biological interactions while retaining an interpretable output. We demonstrate that these extreme points represent cellular programmes reflecting the underlying biology.

This work presents a computationally efficient greedy AA (GAA) algorithm. GAA leverages the underlying geometry of AA, is scalable to larger datasets, and has significantly faster convergence rate. To achieve this, archetypes are learned via sparse projection of data. In the transformed space, GAA employs an iterative subset selection approach to identify archetypes based on the sparsity of convex representations. The work further presents the use of GAA algorithm for extended AA models such as robust and kernel AA. Experimental results show that GAA is considerably faster while performing comparable to existing methods for tasks such as classification, data visualization/categorization.},

The archetypes generally correspond to the extremal points in the dataset and are learned by requiring them to be convex combinations of the training data. In spite of its nice property of interpretability, the method is slow. We propose a variant of archetypal analysis which scales gracefully to large datasets. The core idea is to decouple the binding between data and archetypes and require them to be unit normalized. Geometrically, the method learns a convex hull inside the unit sphere and represents the data by their projections on the closest surfaces of the convex hull. By minimizing the representation error, the method pushes the convex hull surfaces close to the regions of the sphere where the data reside. The vertices of the convex hull are the learned archetypes. We apply the method to human faces and poses to validate its effectiveness in the context of reconstructions and classifications.},

AA thereby forms a polytope representing trade-offs of the distinct aspects in the data. Most existing methods for AA are designed for continuous data and do not exploit the structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose two new optimization frameworks for archetypal analysis for binary data. i) A second order approximation of the AA likelihood based on the Bernoulli distribution with efficient closed-form updates using an active set procedure for learning the convex combinations defining the archetypes, and a sequential minimal optimization strategy for learning the observation specific reconstructions. ii) A Bernoulli likelihood based version of the principal convex hull analysis (PCHA) algorithm originally developed for least squares optimization. We compare these approaches with the only existing binary AA procedure relying on multiplicative updates and demonstrate their superiority on both synthetic and real binary data. Notably, the proposed optimization frameworks for AA can easily be extended to other data distributions providing generic efficient optimization frameworks for AA based on tailored likelihood functions reflecting the underlying data distribution.},

We show via simulation and a real case study that this is a misinterpretation of the difference between the ROC and PR spaces, showing that the ROC curve is robust to class imbalance, while the PR curve is highly sensitive to class imbalance. Furthermore, we show that class imbalance cannot be easily disentangled from classifier performance measured via PR-AUC.},

Given a nonnegative data matrix \$X\$, SPA identifies an index set \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$ such that there exists a nonnegative matrix \$H\$ with \$X \textbackslash approx X(:,\textbackslash mathcal\{K\})H\$. SPA has been successfully used as a pure-pixel search algorithm in hyperspectral unmixing and for anchor word selection in document classification. Moreover, SPA is provably robust in low-noise settings. The main drawbacks of SPA are that it is not robust to outliers and does not take the data fitting term into account when selecting the indices in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$. In this paper, we propose a new SPA variant, dubbed Robust SPA (RSPA), that is robust to outliers while still being provably robust in low-noise settings, and that takes into account the reconstruction error for selecting the indices in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{K\}\$. We illustrate the effectiveness of RSPA on synthetic data sets and hyperspectral images.},

Despite the sustained effort to make IG methods more data-efficient, it remains an open question how to select a training data subset that can theoretically and practically perform on par with the full dataset. Here we develop CRAIG, a method to select a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data that closely estimates the full gradient by maximizing a submodular function. We prove that applying IG to this subset is guaranteed to converge to the (near)optimal solution with the same convergence rate as that of IG for convex optimization. As a result, CRAIG achieves a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of the subset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous method for data-efficient training of general machine learning models. Our extensive set of experiments show that CRAIG, while achieving practically the same solution, speeds up various IG methods by up to 6x for logistic regression and 3x for training deep neural networks.},

This methodology is applied to the Australasian region, where it identifies instances of anomalous sea-surface temperatures, frequently associated with marine heatwaves, as well as the broadscale oceanic and atmospheric conditions associated with those extreme events. Additionally, we use archetype analysis to assess the ability of a low-resolution climate model to accurately represent the teleconnection patterns associated with extreme climate variability, and discuss the implications for the predictability of these impactful events.},

This decomposition is unique only if the true archetypes are non-negative and sufficiently sparse (or the weights are sufficiently sparse), a regime that is captured by the separability condition and its generalizations. In this paper, we study an approach to NMF that can be traced back to the work of Cutler and Breiman (1994) and does not require the data to be separable, while providing a generally unique decomposition. We optimize the trade-off between two objectives: we minimize the distance of the data points from the convex envelope of the archetypes (which can be interpreted as an empirical risk), while minimizing the distance of the archetypes from the convex envelope of the data (which can be interpreted as a data-dependent regularization). The archetypal analysis method of (Cutler, Breiman, 1994) is recovered as the limiting case in which the last term is given infinite weight. We introduce a `uniqueness condition' on the data which is necessary for exactly recovering the archetypes from noiseless data. We prove that, under uniqueness (plus additional regularity conditions on the geometry of the archetypes), our estimator is robust. While our approach requires solving a non-convex optimization problem, we find that standard optimization methods succeed in finding good solutions both for real and synthetic data.},

However, can one construct small data summaries for a wide range of clustering problems simultaneously?

  abstract = {Archetypal analysis is a data decomposition method that describes each observation in a dataset as a convex combination of ”pure types” or archetypes. These archetypes represent extrema of a data space in which there is a trade-off between features, such as in biology where different combinations of traits provide optimal fitness for different environments. Existing methods for archetypal analysis work well when a linear relationship exists between the feature space and the archetypal space. However, such methods are not applicable to systems where the feature space is generated non-linearly from the combination of archetypes, such as in biological systems or image transformations. Here, we propose a reformulation of the problem such that the goal is to learn a non-linear transformation of the data into a latent archetypal space. To solve this problem, we introduce Archetypal Analysis network (AAnet), which is a deep neural network framework for learning and generating from a latent archetypal representation of data. We demonstrate state-of-the-art recovery of ground-truth archetypes in non-linear data domains, show AAnet can generate from data geometry rather than from data density, and use AAnet to identify biologically meaningful archetypes in single-cell gene expression data.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) using archetypal regularization. The goal is to represent a collection of data points as nonnegative linear combinations of a few nonnegative sparse factors with appealing geometric properties, arising from the use of archetypal regularization. We generalize the notion of robustness studied in Javadi and Montanari (2019) (without sparsity) to the notions of (a) strong robustness that implies each estimated archetype is close to the underlying archetypes and (b) weak robustness that implies there exists at least one recovered archetype that is close to the underlying archetypes. Our theoretical results on robustness guarantees hold under minimal assumptions on the underlying data, and applies to settings where the underlying archetypes need not be sparse. We present theoretical results and illustrative examples to strengthen the insights underlying the notions of robustness. We propose new algorithms for our optimization problem; and present numerical experiments on synthetic and real data sets that shed further insights into our proposed framework and theoretical developments.},

A by-product of the analysis is an O({\textbar}E{\textbar}) algorithm that identifies a dominating set in G2, the square of a graph G, the size of which is no larger than the size of the minimum dominating set in the graph G. The key combinatorial object used is called a strong stable set, and we prove the NP-completeness of the corresponding decision problem.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that the degree of social anhedonia reflects the vulnerability for developing schizophrenia. However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.},

However, hard state assignment approaches assume that the brain traverses microstates in a discrete rather than continuous fashion. We present multimodal, multisubject directional archetypal analysis as a scale and polarity invariant extension to archetypal analysis using a loss function based on the Watson distribution. With this method, EEG/MEG microstates are modeled using subject- and modality-specific {\textbackslash}textit\{archetypes\} that are representative, distinct topographic maps between which the brain continuously traverses. Archetypes are specified as convex combinations of unit norm input data based on a shared generator matrix, thus assuming that the timing of neural responses to stimuli is consistent across subjects and modalities. The input data is reconstructed as convex combinations of archetypes using a subject- and modality-specific continuous archetypal mixing matrix. We showcase the model on synthetic data and an openly available face perception event-related potential data set with concurrently recorded EEG and MEG. In synthetic and unimodal experiments, we compare our model to conventional Euclidean multisubject archetypal analysis. We also contrast our model to a directional clustering model with discrete state assignments to highlight the advantages of modeling state trajectories rather than hard assignments. We find that our approach successfully models scale and polarity invariant data, such as microstates, accounting for intersubject and intermodal variability. The model is readily extendable to other modalities ensuring component correspondence while elucidating spatiotemporal signal variability.},

The optimal cluster solution represents a trade-off between discrepancy and the complexity of the underlying fuzzy c-partition. We begin by testing the effectiveness of the proposed index using two sets of synthetic data, one comprising a well-defined cluster structure and the other containing only noise. Then we use datasets arising from real life problems. Our results are compared to those provided by several available indices and their goodness is judged by an external measure of similarity. We find substantial evidence supporting our index as a credible alternative to the cluster validation problem, especially when it concerns structureless data.},

Moreover, it leverages OmniPath, a meta-resource comprising over 100 databases of prior knowledge. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across top methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators.},

For example, in clustering problems, the input is a set of points in some metric space, and a common goal is to compute a set of centers in some other space (points, lines) that will minimize the sum of distances to these points. In database queries, we may need to compute such a some for a specific query set of \$k\$ centers.

Traditional algorithms can then be applied on these coresets to maintain the approximated optimal solutions. The challenge is to design coresets with provable tradeoff between their size and approximation error.

Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods' predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide LIANA, a LIgand-receptor ANalysis frAmework as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods.},

  abstract = {SCANPY is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with SCANPY, we present ANNDATA, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).},
