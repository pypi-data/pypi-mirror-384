**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - 1,966/2,010 contracts have full Greeks**

| Greek | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Delta** | 0.573 (ATM calls) | Directional exposure - how much option price changes per $1 stock move |
| **Gamma** | Available | Rate of change of delta |

**Coverage:** Near-the-money and ATM options have complete Greeks  
**Note:** Deep ITM options may not have Greeks calculated by market makers

### 2. OPTIONS FLOW METRICS
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Put/Call Ratio (Volume)** | 0.495 | **Bullish** - More call volume than puts |
| **Put/Call Ratio (OI)** | 0.709 | Moderate bullish bias |
| **Total Call Volume** | 159,347 | High activity in calls |
| **Total Put Volume** | 78,908 | Lower put activity |
| **Total Call OI** | 987,153 | Strong call interest |

### 3. VOLATILITY INDICATORS
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

| Indicator | Value | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **30-Day Realized Vol** | 23.12% | Actual historical volatility |
| **20-Day Realized Vol** | 21.42% | Recent volatility lower |
| **10-Day Realized Vol** | 26.06% | Short-term vol elevated |
| **ATM Implied Vol** | 39.99% | Market expects 40% annualized vol |
| **IV vs Realized** | +16.87% | **Options are expensive!** |

**Key Insight:** Implied volatility (39.99%) is significantly higher than realized volatility (23.12%). This means:
- Options are trading at a premium
- Market expects more volatility than recently experienced
- **Selling premium strategies favored** (if you disagree with high IV)
- **Buying options is expensive** (paying 173% of realized vol)

**VIX Data:** ‚ùå Not available (ticker format issue - will fix)

### 4. SENTIMENT INDICATORS
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **IV Skew** | -0.0291 (-7.27%) | **BULLISH** |
| **ATM Call IV** | 39.99% | Calls trading at higher IV |
| **ATM Put IV** | 37.08% | Puts cheaper than calls |

**Interpretation of Negative Skew:**
- Calls are MORE expensive than puts (unusual)
- Typically, puts have higher IV (protective demand)
- Negative skew suggests strong bullish positioning
- Market participants willing to pay premium for upside exposure

### 5. TECHNICAL INDICATORS
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

#### Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2œÉ)
| Band | Price | Status |

| Upper Band | $255.65 | 1.56% away |
| Middle Band (SMA) | $247.35 | Current reference |
| Lower Band | $239.06 | Support level |
| **Current Price** | **$251.71** | **76.3% position** |
| Bandwidth | 6.71% | Moderate volatility |

**Interpretation:** Stock at 76.3% position means it's in upper portion of bands but not overbought. Approaching upper band but has room to move higher.

| Level | Price | Analysis |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Point of Control** | $245.52 | Highest volume traded here |
| Value Area High | $245.52 | Top of 70% volume zone |
| Value Area Low | $241.59 | Bottom of 70% volume zone |

## ‚ùå INDICATORS NOT AVAILABLE (Require Market-Wide Data)

### 7. ADVANCED GREEKS
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES CALCULATION - Not provided by Polygon**

These higher-order Greeks require:
- **Vanna**: ‚àÇDelta/‚àÇIV - sensitivity of delta to volatility changes
- **Charm**: ‚àÇDelta/‚àÇTime - rate of delta decay
- **Vomma**: ‚àÇVega/‚àÇIV - sensitivity of vega to volatility
  
**Why not available:** Polygon provides first-order Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) but not second-order derivatives. These would need to be calculated using Black-Scholes model with finite difference methods.

**Can calculate if needed:** Yes, with additional code using scipy and option pricing models.

---

### 8. MARKET BREADTH INDICATORS
**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT AVAILABLE - Requires Market-Wide Data**

These indicators require data across all stocks:

| Indicator | Why Not Available |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Advance-Decline Line** | Needs all NYSE/NASDAQ stocks' daily moves |
| **New Highs/New Lows** | Needs 52-week data for entire market |
| **McClellan Oscillator** | Needs breadth data (advancing vs declining issues) |

**Workaround:** Could fetch these from market summary APIs or specialized breadth data providers.

---

### 9. VIX TERM STRUCTURE
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY AVAILABLE**

- VIX current level: ‚ùå Failed (ticker format issue)
- VVIX: ‚ùå Not attempted yet
- VIX futures term structure: ‚ùå Would need VIX futures data

**Can fix:** Yes, need to use correct Polygon ticker format for indices.

### 10. FEAR & GREED INDEX

## üéØ KEY INSIGHTS FROM AVAILABLE DATA

### BULLISH SIGNALS:
1. ‚úÖ Put/Call Ratio 0.495 - More calls than puts
2. ‚úÖ Negative IV Skew (-7.27%) - Calls more expensive than puts
3. ‚úÖ Trading 10.61% above Max Pain
4. ‚úÖ Price above Volume Profile value area
5. ‚úÖ RSI at 53 - Room for upside

### CAUTION SIGNALS:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è IV 73% above realized volatility - Options expensive
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Approaching Bollinger Band upper limit (76.3% position)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è MACD histogram negative (momentum weakening)

### OPTIONS TRADING IMPLICATIONS:
- **For Buyers:** Options are expensive (IV elevated). Consider waiting for IV crush or buying further OTM.
- **For Sellers:** Good environment for selling premium (high IV vs realized). Consider credit spreads or covered calls.
- **For ITM Calls:** Delta ~0.57 means good leverage, but time premium is elevated due to high IV.
