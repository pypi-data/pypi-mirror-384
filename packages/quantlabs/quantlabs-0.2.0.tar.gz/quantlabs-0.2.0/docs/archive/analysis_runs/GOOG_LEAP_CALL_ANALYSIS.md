## üí° RECOMMENDED STRATEGIES

### Strategy A: WAIT for Pullback (BEST) ‚≠ê

**Action:** Wait for stock to pull back to $240-245

**Rationale:**
1. Stock likely to mean-revert to analyst targets
2. Options will be cheaper at lower IV
3. Better risk/reward entering near support
4. More time value preserved

**Entry Triggers:**
- Stock pulls back to $242 (mean target)
- Stock hits $240 (strong support)
- Analysts raise targets above $250 (validates current price)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (be patient)

**What to Do While Waiting:**
- Monitor analyst target revisions
- Watch for pullback to $240-245
- Set price alerts at $245, $242, $240
- Prepare capital for quick entry

---

### Strategy B: Deep ITM LEAP (Conservative)

**If you must buy now, this is the safest approach**

**Specifications:**
- **Strike Price:** $220 or $230 (deep ITM)
- **Expiration:** January 2027 (16 months)
- **Delta Target:** 0.70-0.80
- **Approximate Cost:** $35-40 per share ($3,500-4,000 per contract)

**Why Deep ITM?**
‚úÖ Acts like stock ownership (70-80% of stock moves)
‚úÖ Less time value = less theta decay
‚úÖ Less affected by IV changes
‚úÖ Intrinsic value: $21.71-31.71 (already in the money)
‚úÖ Safer if stock pulls back to $240

**Break-Even Analysis ($230 Strike):**
- Cost: ~$35 per share
- Break-even: $265 at expiration (+5.3% from current)
- Current intrinsic: $21.71
- Time premium: ~$13.29

**Profit Scenarios ($230 Strike):**
| Stock Price @ Exp | Option Value | Profit/Loss | Return |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| $280 (Bull) | $50 | +$15 | +43% |
| $270 (Base) | $40 | +$5 | +14% |
| $260 (Moderate) | $30 | -$5 | -14% |
| $250 (Current) | $20 | -$15 | -43% |
| $240 (Target) | $10 | -$25 | -71% |

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ High delta captures most upside
- ‚úÖ Protected if stock pulls back moderately
- ‚úÖ Less IV crush risk
- ‚úÖ Can sell covered calls against it

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High upfront cost ($3,500-4,000)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited leverage (70-80% vs 100% stock)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still loses if stock drops significantly

---

### Strategy C: ATM LEAP (Moderate Leverage)

**For more aggressive positioning with moderate risk**

**Specifications:**
- **Strike Price:** $250 or $255 (at-the-money)
- **Expiration:** January 2027 (16 months)
- **Delta Target:** 0.50-0.60
- **Approximate Cost:** $20-25 per share ($2,000-2,500 per contract)

‚úÖ Balanced risk/reward
‚úÖ 50-60% delta (meaningful leverage)
‚úÖ Moderate cost ($2,000-2,500)
‚úÖ Benefits from upside moves
‚úÖ More leverage than deep ITM

**Break-Even Analysis ($250 Strike):**
- Cost: ~$22 per share
- Break-even: $272 at expiration (+8.1% from current)
- Current intrinsic: $1.71
- Time premium: ~$20.29

**Profit Scenarios ($250 Strike):**
| Stock Price @ Exp | Option Value | Profit/Loss | Return |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| $300 (Bull) | $50 | +$28 | +127% |
| $285 (Target High) | $35 | +$13 | +59% |
| $270 (Base) | $20 | -$2 | -9% |
| $260 | $10 | -$12 | -55% |
| $240 (Target) | $0 | -$22 | -100% |

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Good leverage (2.5-3x stock returns)
- ‚úÖ Moderate cost ($2,000-2,500)
- ‚úÖ Benefits from volatility increase
- ‚úÖ Higher returns if bullish thesis plays out

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher theta decay than ITM
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More IV risk (expensive now)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose 100% if stock at $250 or below at expiration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Entering at potentially overvalued price

---

### Strategy D: OTM LEAP (Aggressive/Speculative)

**NOT RECOMMENDED at current prices**

**Specifications:**
- **Strike Price:** $270-280 (out-of-the-money)
- **Expiration:** January 2027
- **Delta Target:** 0.30-0.40
- **Approximate Cost:** $10-15 per share ($1,000-1,500 per contract)

**Why NOT Recommended:**
‚ùå Stock already above fair value
‚ùå Need 7-11% move just to break even

‚ùå Very high IV crush risk
‚ùå Speculative when stock expensive

**Only Consider If:**
- You're extremely bullish on AI disruption

## ‚è∞ TIMING CONSIDERATIONS

### Why NOW is Suboptimal

**1. Stock Above Targets**
- Current: $251.71
- Mean target: $242.21
- Overpaying by 3.8%

**2. Elevated IV (VIX 20.64)**
- Options premiums inflated
- IV crush risk when VIX normalizes

**3. Near-term Pullback Likely**
- Stock ran ahead of fundamentals
- Targets suggest -3.8% downside
- Better entry in 2-4 weeks

### Best Entry Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Pullback to Mean Target**
- Wait for $242 (mean analyst target)
- IV likely lower
- Options ~10-15% cheaper
- Better risk/reward

**Scenario 2: Deeper Pullback**
- Stock hits $235-240 (support zone)
- Excellent entry for LEAPs
- Options 15-20% cheaper
- High probability of success

**Scenario 3: Breakout Above $255**
- Analysts raise targets above $260
- Confirms bullish momentum
- Pay up but with conviction
- Reduces risk of pullback

### Exit Strategies

**Profit Taking:**
