## Training Time Estimates

### HIST Model Training (13K stocks, 120 days)

**Setup**:
- Features: Alpha360 (360 features × 60 day sequences)
- Stocks: ~13,000 stocks
- Training samples: ~120 days × 3,000 stocks = 360K samples
- Epochs: 200 (with early stopping ~50-100)
- Batch size: 256-512

**Expected Training Time on M4 MacBook Air**:

| Component | Time per Epoch | Total (100 epochs) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Data loading | 10-20 sec | 15-30 min |
| Forward pass | 30-60 sec | 50-100 min |
| Backward pass | 30-60 sec | 50-100 min |
| Optimizer step | 5-10 sec | 8-15 min |
| **Total per epoch** | **1.5-3 min** | **2.5-5 hours** |

**With early stopping** (typically stops at 50-80 epochs):
- **Estimated total**: **2-4 hours** ✅

**Comparison**:
- CPU-only (no GPU): 10-20 hours
- M1 MacBook Air (8GB): 4-6 hours
- **M4 MacBook Air (24GB)**: **2-4 hours** ⭐
- RTX 3090 workstation: 1-2 hours
- RTX 4090 workstation: 0.5-1 hour

### XGBoost Training (for comparison)

**Current performance** (you've already tested):
- Training time: ~5 minutes (CPU-only)
- M4 is extremely fast for gradient boosting

## Recommendations

### 1. ✅ Use Your M4 for Training

**Pros**:
- Fast enough (2-4 hours is very reasonable)
- No need for cloud GPUs (saves $$$)
- Can iterate quickly during development
- Unified memory is perfect for HIST architecture

**Cons**:
- Not as fast as high-end desktop GPUs (but acceptable!)
- Battery will drain quickly (use power adapter)
- MacBook will get warm (this is normal)

### 2. Optimize for M4

**PyTorch Settings**:
```python
# Use Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend
device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")

# Optimal batch size for 24GB
batch_size = 512  # Can go up to 1024 if needed

# Enable Metal optimization
torch.set_num_threads(4)  # Use 4 performance cores

# Pin memory for faster data loading
DataLoader(..., pin_memory=True, num_workers=4)
```

### 3. Monitor Temperature

```bash
# Install and use istats to monitor
sudo gem install iStats
istats

# Keep below 95°C during training (normal: 70-85°C)
# Ensure good ventilation
# Consider laptop stand for airflow
```

### 4. Power Settings

```bash
# Disable sleep during training
caffeinate -i uv run qrun configs/hist_config.yaml

# Or use system settings:
# System Settings → Battery → Prevent automatic sleeping on power adapter
```

## Comparison with Cloud Options

### AWS/GCP GPU Instances

**g4dn.xlarge** (NVIDIA T4):
- **Cost**: $0.526/hour
- **Performance**: Similar to M4 (maybe 1.5x faster)
- **4 hour training**: $2.10
- **Monthly development** (100 runs): $210

**p3.2xlarge** (NVIDIA V100):
- **Cost**: $3.06/hour
- **Performance**: 3-4x faster than M4
- **1 hour training**: $3.06
- **Monthly development**: $306

**Your M4 MacBook Air**:
- **Cost**: $0 (you already own it!)
- **Performance**: Good enough for development
- **Benefit**: Iterate locally, deploy best models only

**Recommendation**: Use M4 for development, cloud only if you need 100+ experiments/day

## PyTorch Installation for M4

```bash
# Install PyTorch with MPS support (Apple Silicon GPU)
cd /Users/zheyuanzhao/workspace/quantlab/qlib_repo
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Verify installation
uv run python -c "
import torch
print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'MPS available: {torch.backends.mps.is_available()}')
print(f'MPS built: {torch.backends.mps.is_built()}')

# Test GPU
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device('mps')
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    y = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
    z = x @ y
    print('✓ MPS GPU test successful!')
"
```

## Expected HIST Performance on Your M4

### Training Metrics

Based on M-series benchmarks:

**Speed**:
- **Data loading**: 500-1000 samples/sec
- **Training throughput**: 150-250 samples/sec
- **GPU utilization**: 70-90% (Metal backend)
- **Memory usage**: 6-8 GB peak

**Quality**:
- Model quality: Same as any GPU (deterministic)
- Rank IC improvement: 0 → 0.02-0.04 (expected)
- No quality difference vs cloud training

### Thermal Management

**Normal operating temps during training**:
- CPU: 70-85°C (normal)
- GPU: 65-80°C (normal)
- Case: Warm to touch (normal)

**If thermal throttling occurs** (>95°C sustained):
- Reduce batch size: 512 → 256
- Reduce num_workers: 4 → 2
- Enable fan control software
- Improve ventilation

---

## Storage Consideration

**Your qlib data location**: `/Volumes/sandisk/quantmini-data/`

This appears to be an **external drive**. Check speed:

```bash
# Test read speed
time dd if=/Volumes/sandisk/quantmini-data/data/qlib/stocks_daily/features/close.bin of=/dev/null bs=1m count=1024

# If slow (<500 MB/s), consider:
# 1. Copy data to internal SSD for training
# 2. Use caching in DataLoader
# 3. Pre-load dataset into memory (you have 24GB!)
```

**Recommendation**:
- If external SSD: Fine (should be 1000+ MB/s)
- If external HDD: Copy to internal SSD before training

---

## Final Verdict: ✅ GO FOR IT!

### Summary

**Your MacBook Air M4 24GB is EXCELLENT for HIST training:**

✅ **CPU**: Top-tier M4 chip (10 cores) - Fast preprocessing
✅ **GPU**: 10-core GPU + Neural Engine - Full PyTorch MPS acceleration
✅ **Memory**: 24 GB unified - More than enough (16GB spare)
✅ **Speed**: 2-4 hour training - Very reasonable for development
✅ **Cost**: $0 additional - You already own it!

**Comparison**:
- **Better than**: Any CPU-only solution (10x faster)
- **Better than**: Low-end GPUs (GTX 1650, MX-series)
- **Comparable to**: Mid-range GPUs (GTX 1660 Ti, RTX 2060)
- **Slower than**: High-end GPUs (RTX 3090, A100) - but 1/100th the cost!

**Recommendation**:
1. ✅ Use M4 for HIST development (next 2-4 weeks)
2. ✅ Iterate locally to find best hyperparameters
3. ✅ Deploy best model config only
4. ⚠️ Only use cloud if you need >50 experiments/day

## Next Steps

1. **Install PyTorch** with MPS support (5 minutes)
2. **Wait for stock2concept** to finish (~10 more minutes)
3. **Configure HIST** with Alpha360 features (10 minutes)
4. **Start training** (~2-4 hours first run)
5. **Monitor and iterate** (your M4 makes this fast!)

**You're all set to train HIST on your MacBook Air! 🚀**
