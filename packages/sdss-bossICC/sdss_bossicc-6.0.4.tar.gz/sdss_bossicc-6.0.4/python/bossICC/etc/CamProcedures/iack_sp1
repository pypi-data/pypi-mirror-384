# These two lines were added in October 2025 to address two issues. First, we
# switched the camera controller for sp1 to use the sp2 spare. sp2 sets different
# serial read voltages for the red chip. For sp1 those voltages should be 50 and 85
# for CCDs 0 and 1 respectively (approximately -8 and -6.7 V respectively).
# Additionally we started seeing a CTE issue on the top left quadrant of the red chip
# caused by a trap in the serial register. To mitigate this we are decreasing the
# serial read voltage for the top two channels (CCD 0) to 38 (-8.5 V).
# They should be removed if we go back to the original sp1 controller (unless we want
# to keep the lower voltage for CTE mitigation).
