## Learning Path Structure

### üü¢ Beginner Level (Getting Started)

#### Core Concepts
- **Tables and Schemas** - Understanding data organization
- **Basic Operators** - where, take, project, sort
- **Data Types** - string, datetime, int, bool, dynamic
- **Simple Filtering** - Equality, comparison, basic logic

#### Essential Operators
```kql
// 1. Data Exploration - See what's in a table
TableName
| take 10

// 2. Column Selection - Choose specific fields
TableName
| project TimeGenerated, User, Action

// 3. Filtering - Find specific records
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where User == "alice@contoso.com"

// 4. Sorting - Order results
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### Practice Exercises
1. **Find recent records** - Get last 100 entries from any table
2. **Filter by time** - Show data from the last hour
3. **Select columns** - Display only timestamp and key identifier
4. **Basic counting** - Count total records in a table

### üü° Intermediate Level (Data Analysis)

#### Advanced Filtering
- **Complex Conditions** - and, or, not operations
- **Pattern Matching** - contains, startswith, matches regex
- **List Operations** - in, !in for multiple values
- **Null Handling** - isnull, isnotnull, coalesce

#### Aggregation and Grouping
```kql
// 1. Basic Aggregation - Count all records
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| count

// 2. Grouping - Count by category
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize Count = count() by ActionType

// 3. Multiple Aggregations - Various statistics
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize 
    TotalEvents = count(),
    UniqueUsers = dcount(UserId),
    AvgDuration = avg(DurationMs)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)

// 4. Time-based Analysis - Trends over time
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize EventCount = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart
```

#### Join Operations
```kql
// Inner Join - Match records between tables
Table1
| join (Table2) on CommonColumn

// Left Join - Keep all records from left table
Table1
| join kind=leftouter (Table2) on CommonColumn

// Lookup - Enrich with reference data
EventTable
| lookup UserTable on UserId
```

#### Practice Exercises
1. **Time bucketing** - Group events by hour/day
2. **User behavior** - Count actions per user
3. **Error analysis** - Find and categorize error types
4. **Performance metrics** - Calculate average response times

### üî¥ Advanced Level (Complex Analysis)

#### Time Series Analysis
```kql
// 1. Moving Averages - Smooth out noise
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| make-series Count = count() on TimeGenerated step 1h
| extend MovingAvg = series_fir(Count, repeat(1, 24))
| render timechart

// 2. Anomaly Detection - Find unusual patterns
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| make-series Count = count() on TimeGenerated step 1h
| extend Anomalies = series_decompose_anomalies(Count)
| render anomalychart

// 3. Forecasting - Predict future values
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| make-series Count = count() on TimeGenerated step 1h
| extend Forecast = series_decompose_forecast(Count, 24)
| render timechart
```

#### Advanced Functions
```kql
// 1. Window Functions - Rank and percentiles
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| extend Rank = row_number() over (partition by UserId order by TimeGenerated desc)
| where Rank <= 5

// 2. String Processing - Parse and extract
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| extend ParsedData = parse_json(JsonColumn)
| extend ErrorCode = extract(@"Error=(\d+)", 1, Message)

// 3. Dynamic Data - Work with arrays and objects
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| mv-expand Tags
| where Tags == "important"
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **Query Planning** - Understanding execution order
- **Index Usage** - Leveraging clustered columns
- **Memory Management** - Limiting result sets
- **Parallel Processing** - Using partition operators

### üéØ Specialized Topics

#### Security Analysis
```kql
// Failed Login Analysis
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625  // Failed logon
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by Account, Computer
| where FailedAttempts > 10
| sort by FailedAttempts desc
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```kql
// Response Time Percentiles
RequestTable
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize 
    p50 = percentile(Duration, 50),
    p90 = percentile(Duration, 90),
    p95 = percentile(Duration, 95),
    p99 = percentile(Duration, 99)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| render timechart
```

#### Resource Utilization
```kql
// CPU Utilization Trends
PerformanceTable
| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize AvgCPU = avg(CounterValue) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart
```
