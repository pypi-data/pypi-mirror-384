## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Agentor is an AI-driven task automation system built around multi-agent coordination and intelligent memory management. The system's core business logic is organized into three main pillars:

## Multi-Agent Orchestration (Importance Score: 95)
The hub in `src/agentor/agenthub/main.py` implements a sophisticated agent handoff system where:
- A triage agent evaluates incoming requests and routes them to specialized agents
- Agents can dynamically transfer control based on required expertise
- Cross-tool intelligence enables data correlation across different services

## Google Services Integration Layer (Importance Score: 85)
Located in `src/agentor/integrations/google/google_agent.py`, this component:
- Manages secure OAuth-based access to Gmail and Calendar services
- Implements privacy-preserving read-only operations
- Provides natural language interfaces to Google service APIs
- Enables contextual search across email and calendar data

## Memory Management System (Importance Score: 80)
The memory subsystem in `src/agentor/memory/api.py` and `src/agentor/memory/embedding.py`:
- Maintains conversation context using LanceDB vector storage
- Implements semantic search for relevant conversation retrieval
- Provides tools for agents to store and access historical interactions
- Enables cross-session context preservation

Key business workflows connect these components:
1. User requests are processed through the multi-agent system
2. Specialized agents access Google services through the integration layer
3. Contextual information is preserved and retrieved via the memory system
4. Results are delivered back through the conversational interface
