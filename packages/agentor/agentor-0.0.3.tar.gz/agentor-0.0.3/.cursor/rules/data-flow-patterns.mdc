# data-flow-patterns

## Core Agent Communication Flow (Importance Score: 95)
- Agent Hub (`src/agentor/agenthub/main.py`) orchestrates multi-agent communication
- Triage agent evaluates requests and routes to specialized agents
- Cross-agent handoff protocol enables task delegation between specialized agents

## Memory System Data Flow (Importance Score: 90)
`src/agentor/memory/api.py` implements:
- Bi-directional conversation storage flow between agents and LanceDB
- Vector embedding pipeline for semantic search capabilities
- Contextual retrieval system for maintaining conversation history

## Google Integration Data Pipeline (Importance Score: 85)
`src/agentor/integrations/google/google_agent.py`:
- OAuth credential flow management for Google services
- Bi-directional data synchronization with Gmail/Calendar APIs
- Read-only data access patterns for privacy protection

## Agent-Memory Interaction Pattern (Importance Score: 80)
`src/agentor/agenthub/memagent.py`:
- Memory agent handles persistent storage requests
- Conversation embedding and indexing workflow
- Context retrieval pattern for maintaining conversation state

## External Service Integration Flow (Importance Score: 75)
- Standardized tool integration pattern for external services
- Credential management flow for service authentication
- Service-specific data transformation pipelines

## Cross-Tool Intelligence Flow (Importance Score: 70)
- Data correlation pattern between different tools
- Context sharing mechanism between specialized agents
- Unified response formatting pipeline for multi-source data
