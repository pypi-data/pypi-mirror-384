## Core Memory Components

### Conversational Memory Store (Importance Score: 95)
- `src/agentor/memory/api.py`
- LanceDB-based memory system for storing and retrieving conversational context
- Custom schema for conversation storage including metadata, timestamps, and embedding vectors
- Semantic search capabilities for finding relevant historical conversations
- Maintains conversation threads and context across multiple interactions

### Embedding Generation System (Importance Score: 85)
- `src/agentor/memory/embedding.py`
- Custom embedding function using sentence transformers
- Converts conversational text into vector representations
- Enables semantic similarity searches across stored conversations
- Maintains embedding consistency for memory retrieval operations

### Memory Agent Implementation (Importance Score: 90)
- `src/agentor/agenthub/memagent.py`
- Specialized agent for memory operations
- Tools for searching, retrieving, and adding to conversation memory
- Handles memory context maintenance during agent handoffs
- Manages conversation threading and relevance scoring

### Memory Tools (Importance Score: 80)
- `src/agentor/memory/tools.py`
- Implements memory_search tool for semantic querying
- memory_get_full_conversation tool for thread retrieval
- memory_add tool for storing new conversations
- Context preservation tools for multi-turn dialogues

### Memory Integration Layer (Importance Score: 75)
- `examples/memory_agent.py`
- Demonstrates memory system integration with agent workflows
- Handles conversation persistence and retrieval
- Implements memory-aware agent responses
- Manages memory context during tool operations
