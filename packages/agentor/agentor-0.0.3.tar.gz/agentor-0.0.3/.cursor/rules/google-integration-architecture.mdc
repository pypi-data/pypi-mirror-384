# google-integration-architecture

## Core Integration Components (Importance Score: 95)
The Google integration architecture is built around a centralized Google Agent that orchestrates access to Gmail and Calendar services while maintaining strict privacy controls. Located in `src/agentor/integrations/google/google_agent.py`, this component provides the foundational integration layer.

## Authentication Flow (Importance Score: 90)
OAuth implementation resides in `src/agentor/integrations/google/creds.py` providing:
- One-time setup command (`zen setup-google`) for Google Cloud Project creation
- Secure credential storage and management
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Separation of desktop and backend OAuth flows


## Integration Architecture Features (Importance Score: 80)

### Privacy-First Design
- Local credential storage
- No data collection by service
- Read-only permissions enforcement
- Secure OAuth token management

### Cross-Service Intelligence
- Correlation between emails and calendar events
- Contextual awareness across Google services
- Unified query handling for multi-service requests

### Backend Integration Support
`examples/google_backend_tool.py` demonstrates:
- Service account authentication
- Headless operation capabilities
- Direct tool usage patterns
