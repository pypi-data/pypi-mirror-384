# The Platonic Universe: Testing The Platonic Representation Hypothesis With Astronomical Data 🔮 💫

This repository contains the code for testing the **Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH)** on astronomical data, as described in our paper "The Platonic Universe: Do Foundation Models See the Same Sky?"

## Background & Motivation

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks trained with different objectives on different data modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of reality in their representation spaces. As models become larger and are trained on more diverse tasks, they should converge toward a "Platonic ideal" representation of underlying reality.

### Why Astronomy?

Astronomical observations provide an ideal testbed for the PRH because:
- **Shared Physical Origin**: Different astronomical observations (images, spectra, photometry) all emerge from the same underlying physics
- **Multiple Modalities**: We can compare representations across fundamentally different data types (like optical images, infrared images, and spectroscopy)
- **Scale**: Modern astronomical surveys provide the data volume necessary to test convergence across multiple model architectures

Our results (below) show that **larger models exhibit more similar representations**, even when trained across different data modalities. This suggests that astronomical foundation models may be able to leverage pre-trained general-purpose architectures.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/UniverseTBD/platonic-universe.git](https://github.com/UniverseTBD/platonic-universe.git)
    cd platonic-universe    
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using uv:**
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv sync
    ```
3. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   uv pip install .
   ```

### Quick Start: Running Experiments

There are two methods to run experiments:

1. **Using platonic_universe CLI:**
    ```bash
    platonic_universe run --model vit --mode jwst 
    ```

2. **Using python pakage directly:**
    ```python
    import pu 

    pu.run_experiment("vit", "sdss", batch_size=64, num_workers=1, knn_k=10)
    ``` 



### Supported Models & Datasets

**Models Tested:**
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: Base, Large, Huge
- **DINOv2**: Small, Base, Large, Giant
- **ConvNeXtv2**: Nano, Tiny, Base, Large
- **IJEPA**: Huge, Giant
- **AstroPT**: Astronomy-specific transformer (Small, Base, Large)
- **Specformer**: Spectroscopy-specific model (Enable by uncommenting relevant lines in 'experiments.py')

**Astronomical Datasets:**
- **HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam)**: Ground-based optical imaging (reference baseline)
- **JWST**: Space-based infrared imaging
- **Legacy Survey**: Ground-based optical imaging
- **DESI**: Spectroscopy

### Understanding the Results

The code measures **representational alignment** using the Mutual k-Nearest Neighbour (MKNN) metric:

```python
from pu.metrics import mknn

# Calculate MKNN score between two embedding sets
score = mknn(embeddings_1, embeddings_2, k=10)
print(f"MKNN alignment score: {score:.4f}")
```

**Higher MKNN scores** indicate more similar representations between models or modalities.
