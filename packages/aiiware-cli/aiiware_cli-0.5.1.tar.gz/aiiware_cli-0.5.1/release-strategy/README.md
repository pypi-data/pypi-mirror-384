## üéØ Folder Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns

```
/release-notes/         # WHAT was released (historical records)
/release-strategy/      # HOW to release (operational processes)
/system-design-docs/    # WHY architecture decisions were made
/system-dev-docs/       # WHEN features will be developed (plans)
```

**Example Flow**:
1. Developer builds feature (follows `/system-dev-docs/`)
2. Release manager follows checklist (uses `/release-strategy/`)
3. Product is published (creates entry in `/release-notes/`)

### Version-Specific vs. Process Documentation

| Type | Location | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Version-specific** | `/release-notes/` | `v0.1.0.md` - What changed in this version |
| **Process** | `/release-strategy/` | `vscode-pre-publication-checklist.md` - How to publish any version |
