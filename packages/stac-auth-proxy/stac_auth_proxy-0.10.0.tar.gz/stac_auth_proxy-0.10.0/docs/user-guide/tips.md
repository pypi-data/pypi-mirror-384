# Tips

## CORS

The STAC Auth Proxy does not modify the [CORS response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#the_http_response_headers) from the upstream STAC API. All CORS configuration must be handled by the upstream API.

Because the STAC Auth Proxy introduces authentication, the upstream APIâ€™s CORS settings may need adjustment to support credentials. In most cases, this means:

- [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) must be `true`
- [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) must _not_ be `*`[^CORSNotSupportingCredentials]

## Root Paths

The proxy can be optionally served from a non-root path (e.g., `/api/v1`). Additionally, the proxy can optionally proxy requests to an upstream API served from a non-root path (e.g., `/stac`). To handle this, the proxy will:

- Remove the `ROOT_PATH` from incoming requests before forwarding to the upstream API
- Remove the proxy's prefix from all links in STAC API responses
- Add the `ROOT_PATH` prefix to all links in STAC API responses
- Update the OpenAPI specification to include the `ROOT_PATH` in the servers field
- Handle requests that don't match the `ROOT_PATH` with a 404 response

## Non-OIDC Workaround

If the upstream server utilizes RS256 JWTs but does not utilize a proper OIDC server, the proxy can be configured to work around this by setting the `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` to a statically-hosted OIDC discovery document that points to a valid JWKS endpoint.

## Swagger UI Direct JWT Input

Rather than performing the login flow, the Swagger UI can be configured to accept direct JWT as input with the the following configuration:

```sh
OPENAPI_AUTH_SCHEME_NAME=jwtAuth
OPENAPI_AUTH_SCHEME_OVERRIDE='{
  "type": "http",
  "scheme": "bearer",
  "bearerFormat": "JWT",
  "description": "Paste your raw JWT here. This API uses Bearer token authorization."
}'
```

## Non-proxy Configuration

While the STAC Auth Proxy is designed to work out-of-the-box as an application, it might not address every projects needs. When the need for customization arises, the codebase can instead be treated as a library of components that can be used to augment a FastAPI server.

This may look something like the following:

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from stac_fastapi.api.app import StacApi
from stac_auth_proxy import configure_app, Settings as StacAuthSettings

# Create Auth Settings
auth_settings = StacAuthSettings(
  upstream_url='https://stac-server',  # Dummy value, we don't make use of this value in non-proxy mode
  oidc_discovery_url='https://auth-server/.well-known/openid-configuration',
)

# Setup App
app = FastAPI( ... )

# Apply STAC Auth Proxy middleware
configure_app(app, auth_settings)

# Setup STAC API
api = StacApi( app, ... )
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid using `build_lifespan()` when operating in non-proxy mode, as we are unable to check for the non-existent upstream API.
