This module allows to identify empty stock locations. But also, filled
locations, being empty ones (some movements will empty the location) and
being filled ones (some movements are planned to fill in the location).

Use Cases / Context
===================

Stock logistic managers need to know the empty stock locations in order
to measure the capacity of the warehouse and be able to reorganize it if
it does not fit the current replenishment coverage.

Usage
=====

- Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Locations

- In the list of locations, enable the column visibility 'Fill State'

- You can filter the locations per 'Empty', 'Filled', 'Being Filled' or
  'Being Emptied' property.

- The Customers and Suppliers locations won't have their fill_state
  filled in with 'filled' for performances reasons as too much products
  quantities (aka quants) can exist in those locations.

- Some locations can be excluded too from the computation. Go to the
  desired location and check the 'Exclude From Fill State Computation'
  box.
