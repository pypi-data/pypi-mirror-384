## Tier 1: Development & Learning (Free)

### Target Users
- Students and learners
- Open-source contributors
- Hobbyists and researchers
- Developers exploring AI-assisted development

### Agent Configuration

#### Planning Agent: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Cost**: Free tier
- **Quota**: 1,000 requests/day
- **Capabilities**:
  - Architect prompt generation
  - Technical planning and design
  - Task breakdown and prioritization
  - Specification refinement
  - Architecture decision documentation
- **Gemini 3 Pro:** Expected in the next few months

#### Coding Agent: Qwen 3 Coder
- **Cost**: Free tier
- **Quota**: 2,000 requests/day
- **Capabilities**:
  - Code implementation from specifications
  - Test generation (unit, integration)
  - Code refactoring
  - Documentation generation
  - Bug fixing and optimization

### Infrastructure

#### DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)

Pay only for nodes, LB, disks; smallest nodes start about $12/mo per node. Good docs + generous bandwidth.

If you get a $200 credit when you opened an account. When will my card be charged?

Your card will be charged only after you have utilized the free credits. For example, if you received a $200 credit for 60 days, then that $200 credit is automatically applied to your account. If you spend $25 in that timeframe, then your card will not be charged. If you spend $300, then the $200 credit would be fully utilized and your card will be charged only $100. Since the credit is valid for 60 days, you won't be able to use any remaining credit after 60 days.

#### Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)

A fully-managed service compatible with Kubernetes to help users focus on their applications rather than managing container infrastructure
