## The 5 Reasons to Use Proprietary Extensions

### Reason 1: Performance Requirements ⚡

**When:**
- Latency requirement <5ms per call
- Call frequency >100 per second
- Large data transfers (multi-MB)
- Real-time interactions (autocomplete, syntax highlighting)

**Example:**
```
Code completion while typing:
- MCP: 5-10ms per keystroke → Feels sluggish
- Native: 1-2ms per keystroke → Feels instant
✅ Use proprietary
```

**Real-World Cases:**
- ✅ Real-time code completion
- ✅ Syntax highlighting
- ✅ Live linting
- ✅ High-frequency analytics dashboards
- ❌ GitHub API calls (MCP fine)
- ❌ Database queries (MCP fine, unless 100+/sec)
- ❌ Slack messages (MCP fine)

---

### Reason 2: Deep Platform Integration 🔌

**When:**
- Need access to conversation history
- Need current cursor position
- Need agent's internal state
- Need user preferences from agent
- Need agent's reasoning trace

**Example:**
```
Smart refactoring based on conversation:
- MCP: Cannot access conversation history
- Native: Full access to past interactions
✅ Use proprietary
```

**What MCP CANNOT Access:**
```typescript
// These are ONLY available to native extensions:
- agent.getConversationHistory()
- agent.getCursorPosition()
- agent.getUserPreferences()
- agent.getReasoningTrace()
- agent.getSessionContext()
```

**Real-World Cases:**
- ✅ Context-aware refactoring
- ✅ Learning from user patterns
- ✅ Conversation-based suggestions
- ✅ Session-specific features
- ❌ Standard API calls (MCP fine)
- ❌ Database access (MCP fine)
- ❌ File operations (MCP fine)

---

### Reason 3: Rich UI Components 🎨

**When:**
- Complex configuration forms
- Visual data (charts, graphs)
- File/folder pickers
- Multi-step wizards
- Real-time previews
- Interactive debugging

**Example:**
```
Database configuration:

MCP (text-based):
Agent: "What is the host?"
User: "localhost"
Agent: "What is the port?"
User: "5432"
[30 seconds, 8 messages]

Native (GUI):
[Opens form with all fields]
User: [Fills form, clicks Save]
[5 seconds, 1 interaction]
✅ Use proprietary for complex UI
```

**Real-World Cases:**
- ✅ Configuration wizards (many fields)
- ✅ Visual debugging
- ✅ Chart/graph generation
- ✅ File picker dialogs
- ❌ Simple yes/no questions (MCP fine)
- ❌ Text-based interaction (MCP fine)

---

### Reason 4: Synchronous Operations 🔒

**When:**
- Database transactions (need commit/rollback)
- File locking
- Resource pooling
- Atomic operations
- Critical sections

**Example:**
```
Database transaction:

MCP (problematic):
await mcp.call("begin_transaction")
await mcp.call("insert_user")
❌ Agent crash here = transaction stuck
await mcp.call("commit")

Native (safe):
with db.transaction():
    db.insert_user()
    # Auto commit/rollback
✅ Use proprietary for transactions
```

**Real-World Cases:**
- ✅ Multi-step database transactions
- ✅ File locking during edits
- ✅ Resource pool management
- ✅ State machines
- ❌ Stateless API calls (MCP fine)
- ❌ Independent operations (MCP fine)

---

### Reason 5: Competitive Advantage 🏆

**When:**
- Core competitive differentiator
- Proprietary algorithms
- Strategic partnership exclusive
- Premium feature revenue model
- Intellectual property protection

**Example:**
```
Claude's advanced reasoning:
- If exposed via MCP → Competitors copy
- Kept proprietary → Unique selling point
✅ Use proprietary for competitive features
```

**Real-World Cases:**
- ✅ Proprietary AI reasoning
- ✅ Exclusive partner integrations
- ✅ Premium paid features
- ✅ Trade secret algorithms
- ❌ Standard integrations (use MCP for goodwill)
- ❌ Community tools (use MCP for ecosystem)

## The Hybrid Strategy (Best Practice)

Most sophisticated platforms use BOTH:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Your AI Platform               │
│                                    │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  Proprietary Extensions  │     │
│  │  (Performance + Core)    │     │
│  │  • Code completion       │     │
│  │  • Advanced AI features  │     │
│  └──────────────────────────┘     │
│                                    │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  MCP Interface           │     │
│  │  (Ecosystem)             │     │
│  │  • 100+ community tools  │     │
│  │  • User flexibility      │     │
│  └──────────────────────────┘     │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

Users get:
✅ Fast core features (proprietary)
✅ Huge ecosystem (MCP)
✅ Best of both worlds
```

**Example: Claude Code**
- **Proprietary:** Code completion, agentic planning, conversation optimization
- **MCP:** GitHub, databases, Slack, AWS, 100+ community servers
- **Result:** Fast AND flexible

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Should Use MCP

**GitHub Integration**
- Why: Standard API, not latency-sensitive, benefits ecosystem
- Result: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` used by all agents

**Slack Bot**
- Why: Low frequency, simple API, community benefit
- Result: One MCP server, works everywhere

**Database Queries**
- Why: Occasional queries, MCP latency acceptable
- Result: PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB MCP servers

**AWS Operations**
- Why: Cloud API calls, not performance-critical
- Result: AWS MCP server for all operations

### ⚡ Should Use Proprietary

**Code Completion (Cursor, Claude Code)**
- Why: <2ms latency required, 1000+ calls/minute
- Result: Native extension, feels instant

**Context-Aware Refactoring (Claude Code)**
- Why: Needs conversation history, agent reasoning
- Result: Proprietary feature, competitive advantage

**Visual Debugger (VS Code extensions)**
- Why: Rich UI with breakpoints, call stacks, watches
- Result: Native extension with full IDE integration

**Database Transaction Manager**
- Why: Needs atomic commit/rollback, connection pooling
- Result: Native extension with proper resource management

## Migration Path

**Start with MCP, move to proprietary only if needed:**

```
Week 1-2: Build MCP Server
↓
Week 3-4: Test with multiple agents
↓
Week 5-6: Gather performance data
↓
Decision Point:
├─→ Performance OK? → Stay with MCP ✅
├─→ Need <5ms? → Consider proprietary
├─→ Need agent state? → Consider proprietary
└─→ Need rich UI? → Consider proprietary
```

**Or start proprietary, provide MCP fallback:**

```
Week 1-4: Build proprietary extension
↓
Week 5-6: Optimize performance, validate approach
↓
Week 7-8: Create MCP wrapper for basic features
↓
Result:
├─→ Proprietary: Performance-critical paths
└─→ MCP: Basic functionality for all agents
```

## Quick Reference: Common Extensions

| Extension Type | Use | Reason |
|----------------|-----|--------|
| **GitHub** | MCP | Standard API, ecosystem benefit |
| **Slack** | MCP | Low frequency, simple |
| **PostgreSQL** | MCP | Normal queries |
| **AWS** | MCP | Cloud APIs |
| **File System** | MCP | Not latency-sensitive |
| **Docker** | MCP | Container ops fine with MCP |
| **Kubernetes** | MCP | K8s API not time-critical |
| **Code Completion** | Proprietary | <2ms required |
| **Syntax Highlighting** | Proprietary | Real-time UI |
| **Smart Refactor** | Proprietary | Needs agent context |
| **Config Wizard** | Proprietary | Rich UI needed |
| **Transaction Manager** | Proprietary | Atomic operations |

---

## The Golden Rule

> **"Use MCP unless you can clearly identify one of the five specific reasons for proprietary extensions."**

**When in doubt:** Start with MCP. You can always build proprietary later if needed.

**Best practice:** Even proprietary extensions should provide MCP wrappers for basic functionality.

---

## TL;DR

**MCP (80% of cases):**
- ✅ Default choice
- ✅ Works everywhere
- ✅ Community maintained
- ✅ Future-proof

**Proprietary (20% of cases):**
- ⚡ Performance-critical (<5ms, >100/s)
- 🔌 Deep agent integration (state, history)
- 🎨 Rich UI requirements
- 🔒 Synchronous operations (transactions)
- 🏆 Competitive advantage

**Hybrid (Best):**
- Core features → Proprietary
- Community tools → MCP
- Provide both when possible

**Start Here:**
1. Build with MCP first
2. Measure performance
3. Migrate to proprietary only if you hit one of the five reasons
4. Provide MCP fallback even for proprietary

**Remember:** MCP is the future. Proprietary is for specific needs. Use both strategically.
