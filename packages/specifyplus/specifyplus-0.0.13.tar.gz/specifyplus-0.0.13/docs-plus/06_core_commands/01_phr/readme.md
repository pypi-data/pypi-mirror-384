# Module 10 – Prompt History Records (PHR): Automatic Knowledge Capture

> **Built into Spec Kit: Every AI exchange is automatically captured as a structured artifact—no extra commands needed.**

## The Problem: Lost Knowledge

Every day, developers have hundreds of AI conversations that produce valuable code, insights, and decisions. But this knowledge disappears into chat history, leaving you to:

- **Reinvent solutions** you already figured out
- **Debug without context** of why code was written that way
- **Miss patterns** in what prompts actually work
- **Lose traceability** for compliance and code reviews

## The Solution: Automatic Prompt History Records

**PHRs are created automatically after every significant AI interaction** in Spec Kit. No extra commands, no manual effort—just work normally and get complete documentation of your AI-assisted development journey.

### Core Learning Science Principles

| Principle              | How PHRs Apply                                         | Daily Benefit                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Spaced Repetition**  | Revisit PHRs weekly to reinforce successful strategies | Build muscle memory for effective prompting |
| **Metacognition**      | Reflect on what worked/didn't work in each exchange    | Develop better prompting intuition          |
| **Retrieval Practice** | Search PHRs when facing similar problems               | Access proven solutions instantly           |
| **Interleaving**       | Mix different types of prompts (architect/red/green)   | Strengthen transfer across contexts         |

## How It Works: Completely Automatic

### Setup (One Time)

When you run `specify init`:

```bash
specify init --ai gemini  # Or claude, cursor, copilot, etc.
```

You automatically get:

- ✅ **Implicit PHR creation** built into every command
- ✅ **PHR templates** and scripts
- ✅ **Deterministic location logic** (pre-feature vs feature-specific)
- ✅ **Manual `/phr` command** for custom cases (optional)

### Daily Usage: Just Work Normally

PHRs are created **automatically** after:

```bash
/sp.constitution Define quality standards     → PHR created in docs/prompts/
/sp.specify Create authentication feature     → PHR created in docs/prompts/
/sp.plan Design JWT system                    → PHR created in specs/001-auth/prompts/
/sp.tasks Break down implementation           → PHR created in specs/001-auth/prompts/
/sp.implement Write JWT token generation      → PHR created in specs/001-auth/prompts/
```

Also after general work:

- Technical questions producing code → PHR created
- Debugging or fixing errors → PHR created
- Code explanations → PHR created
- Refactoring → PHR created

**You see:** Brief confirmation like `📝 PHR-0003 recorded`

**That's it!** Keep working, and your knowledge compounds automatically.

---

## Deterministic PHR Location Strategy

PHRs use a **simple, deterministic rule** for where they're stored:

### Before Feature Exists (Pre-Feature Work)

**Location:** `docs/prompts/`  
**Stages:** `constitution`, `spec`  
**Naming:** `0001-title.constitution.prompt.md`

**Use cases:**

- Creating constitution.md
- Writing initial specs

**Example:**

```
docs/
└── prompts/
    ├── 0001-define-quality-standards.constitution.prompt.md
    └── 0002-create-auth-spec.spec.prompt.md
```

**Note:** The `general` stage can also fall back to `docs/prompts/` if no `specs/` directory exists, but will show a warning suggesting to use `constitution` or `spec` stages instead, or create a feature first.

### After Feature Exists (Feature Work)

**Location:** `specs/<feature>/prompts/`  
**Stages:** `architect`, `red`, `green`, `refactor`, `explainer`, `misc`, `general`  
**Naming:** `0001-title.architect.prompt.md`

**Use cases:**

- Feature planning and design
- Implementation work
- Debugging and fixes
- Code refactoring
- General feature work

**Example:**

```
specs/
├── 001-authentication/
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── prompts/
│       ├── 0001-design-jwt-system.architect.prompt.md
│       ├── 0002-implement-jwt.green.prompt.md
│       ├── 0003-fix-token-bug.red.prompt.md
│       └── 0004-setup-docs.general.prompt.md
└── 002-database/
    └── prompts/
        ├── 0001-design-schema.architect.prompt.md
        └── 0002-optimize-queries.refactor.prompt.md
```

### Key Features

- **Local sequence numbering**: Each directory starts at 0001
- **Stage-based extensions**: Files show their type (`.architect.prompt.md`, `.red.prompt.md`)
- **Auto-detection**: Script finds the right feature from branch name or latest numbered feature
- **Clear location rules**:
  - `constitution`, `spec` → always `docs/prompts/`
  - Feature stages → `specs/<feature>/prompts/`
  - `general` → feature context if available, else `docs/prompts/` with warning

## PHR Stages

### Pre-Feature Stages

| Stage          | Extension                 | When to Use                                    | Example                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `constitution` | `.constitution.prompt.md` | Defining quality standards, project principles | Creating constitution.md |
| `spec`         | `.spec.prompt.md`         | Creating business requirements, feature specs  | Writing spec.md          |

### Feature-Specific Stages (TDD Cycle)

| Stage       | Extension              | TDD Phase      | When to Use                                 | Example                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `architect` | `.architect.prompt.md` | **Plan**       | Design, planning, API contracts             | Designing JWT auth system   |
| `red`       | `.red.prompt.md`       | **Red**        | Debugging, fixing errors, test failures     | Fixing token expiration bug |
| `green`     | `.green.prompt.md`     | **Green**      | Implementation, new features, passing tests | Implementing login endpoint |
| `refactor`  | `.refactor.prompt.md`  | **Refactor**   | Code cleanup, optimization                  | Extracting auth middleware  |
| `explainer` | `.explainer.prompt.md` | **Understand** | Code explanations, documentation            | Understanding JWT flow      |
| `misc`      | `.misc.prompt.md`      | **Other**      | Uncategorized feature work                  | General feature questions   |
| `general`   | `.general.prompt.md`   | **Any**        | General work within feature context         | Setup, docs, general tasks  |

**Note:** `general` stage behavior:

- If `specs/` exists: goes to `specs/<feature>/prompts/`
- If no `specs/`: falls back to `docs/prompts/` with warning

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Automatic PHR Creation Flow

When you run any significant command:

1. **You execute work** - `/constitution`, `/specify`, `/plan`, debugging, etc.
2. **AI completes the task** - Creates files, writes code, fixes bugs
3. **Stage auto-detected** - System determines: architect, green, red, refactor, etc.
4. **PHR auto-created** - File generated with proper naming and location
5. **Brief confirmation** - You see: `📝 PHR-0003 recorded`

**All metadata captured automatically:**

- Full user prompt (complete multiline text)
- Response summary
- Files modified
- Tests run
- Stage and feature context
- Timestamps and user info

### Integrated SDD Workflow

```
/constitution → PHR created (docs/prompts/)
     ↓
/specify → PHR created (docs/prompts/)
     ↓
/plan → PHR created (specs/<feature>/prompts/) + ADR suggestion
     ↓
/tasks → PHR created (specs/<feature>/prompts/)
     ↓
/implement → PHR created (specs/<feature>/prompts/)
     ↓
Debug/fix → PHR created (specs/<feature>/prompts/)
     ↓
Refactor → PHR created (specs/<feature>/prompts/)
```

**PHRs compound throughout the entire workflow—automatically.**

### Manual Override (Optional)

You can still use `/phr` explicitly for:

- Custom metadata and labels
- Specific stage override
- Detailed context and links
- Work that wasn't automatically captured

```bash
/phr Define API versioning standards  # Explicit creation with full control
```

But 95% of the time, you won't need to—PHRs just happen!

---

## Daily Workflow with Automatic PHRs

### Morning: Context Loading (2 minutes)

```bash
# Read yesterday's PHRs to rehydrate context
ls specs/*/prompts/*.prompt.md | tail -5 | xargs cat

# Or for pre-feature work
ls docs/prompts/*.prompt.md | tail -5 | xargs cat
```

### During Work: Just Work (PHRs Happen Automatically)

```bash
# You work normally:
/plan Design JWT authentication system
# → AI creates plan.md
# → PHR automatically created: specs/001-auth/prompts/0001-design-jwt-system.architect.prompt.md
# → You see: 📝 PHR-0001 recorded

/implement Create token generation function
# → AI implements the code
# → PHR automatically created: specs/001-auth/prompts/0002-implement-token-gen.green.prompt.md
# → You see: 📝 PHR-0002 recorded

# Debug something:
Fix token expiration bug
# → AI fixes the bug
# → PHR automatically created: specs/001-auth/prompts/0003-fix-expiration-bug.red.prompt.md
# → You see: 📝 PHR-0003 recorded
```

**No `/phr` commands needed!** Every significant interaction is captured automatically.

### Evening: Reflect & Learn (3 minutes)

```bash
# Review today's PHRs
grep -r "Reflection:" specs/*/prompts/ | tail -3

# Find patterns in successful prompts
grep -r "✅ Impact:" specs/*/prompts/ | grep -v "recorded for traceability"

# Count today's PHRs
find specs -name "*.prompt.md" -mtime -1 | wc -l
```

# Find all authentication-related prompts
grep -r "auth" specs/*/prompts/

# Find all prompts about databases
grep -r "database\|sql\|postgres" specs/*/prompts/
```

### Find by Stage

```bash
# Find all debugging sessions (red stage)
find specs -name "*.red.prompt.md"

# Find all architecture planning (architect stage)
find specs -name "*.architect.prompt.md"

# Find all implementations (green stage)
find specs -name "*.green.prompt.md"
```

### Find by File

```bash
# Find prompts that touched specific files
grep -r "auth.py" specs/*/prompts/

# Find prompts that ran specific tests
grep -r "test_login" specs/*/prompts/
```

### Find by Feature

```bash
# List all PHRs for a specific feature

## Why This Works (Learning Science)

### Spaced Repetition

- **Weekly PHR reviews** reinforce successful prompting patterns
- **Searching past PHRs** when facing similar problems builds retrieval strength
- **Pattern recognition** emerges from reviewing your own prompt history

### Metacognition

- **Reflection prompts** in each PHR force you to think about what worked
- **"Next prompts"** section helps you plan follow-up actions
- **Outcome tracking** shows the connection between prompts and results

### Interleaving

- **Stage tagging** (architect/red/green) mixes different types of thinking
- **Context switching** between planning, coding, and debugging strengthens transfer
- **Cross-domain learning** happens when you apply patterns from one area to another

### Retrieval Practice

- **Searching PHRs** forces active recall of past solutions
- **Weekly reviews** strengthen memory consolidation
- **Reapplying patterns** to new problems deepens understanding

---

## Success Metrics

After 1 week of using PHRs, you should have:

- [ ] 20+ PHRs capturing your AI interactions
- [ ] 3+ successful prompt patterns you can reuse
- [ ] 1+ debugging session where PHRs saved you time
- [ ] Clear understanding of what prompts work for your domain

After 1 month:

- [ ] 100+ PHRs organized by feature
- [ ] Searchable knowledge base of effective prompts
- [ ] Measurable reduction in time spent solving similar problems
- [ ] Team members using each other's PHRs as templates

**The goal:** Turn AI assistance from ad-hoc to systematic, building a compounding knowledge base that makes you more effective every day.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Feature stage 'architect' requires specs/ directory and feature context"**

- **Cause**: Using feature stage (`architect`, `red`, `green`, etc.) before specs/ directory exists
- **Solution**: Use pre-feature stages (`constitution`, `spec`) or create a feature first with `/specify`

**"No feature specified and no numbered features found"**

- **Cause**: Working in feature context but no features exist
- **Solution**: Run `/specify` to create your first feature, or specify `--feature` manually

**"Feature directory not found"**

- **Cause**: Specified feature doesn't exist in `specs/`
- **Solution**: Check available features with `ls specs/` or create the feature with `/specify`

**"Warning: No specs/ directory found. Using docs/prompts/ for general stage."**

- **Cause**: Using `general` stage when no specs/ directory exists
- **Not an error**: PHR will be created in `docs/prompts/` as fallback
- **Suggestion**: Consider using `constitution` or `spec` stages for pre-feature work, or create a feature first

### Manual PHR Creation

If needed, you can create PHRs manually:

```bash
# Pre-feature PHR (constitution or spec)
scripts/bash/create-phr.sh \
  --title "Define API standards" \
  --stage constitution \
  --json

# Feature-specific PHR (requires specs/ and feature context)
scripts/bash/create-phr.sh \
  --title "Implement login" \
  --stage green \
  --feature "001-auth" \
  --json

# General stage (falls back to docs/prompts/ if no specs/)
scripts/bash/create-phr.sh \
  --title "Setup CI pipeline" \
  --stage general \
  --json
```

**Note:** The script only creates the file with placeholders. The AI agent must fill all `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` after creation.

## Comparison: PHR vs Traditional Methods

| Aspect            | Traditional (Chat History) | PHR System                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Persistence**   | Lost when chat closes      | Permanent, version-controlled         |
| **Searchability** | Limited to current session | `grep`, `find`, full-text search      |
| **Organization**  | Chronological only         | By feature, stage, file, label        |
| **Team Sharing**  | Screenshots, copy-paste    | Git commits, pull requests            |
| **Traceability**  | None                       | Links to specs, ADRs, PRs             |
| **Learning**      | No reinforcement           | Spaced repetition, retrieval practice |
| **Compliance**    | No audit trail             | Complete history with metadata        |

---

## Summary: PHRs are Automatic

PHRs are **built into Spec Kit** with automatic creation:

✅ **Completely automatic**: Created after every significant command—no extra work  
✅ **Deterministic location**:

- Pre-feature (`constitution`, `spec`) → `docs/prompts/`
- Feature work → `specs/<feature>/prompts/`
- Clear file naming with stage extensions

✅ **Full metadata capture**: Prompts, responses, files, tests, timestamps  
✅ **Stage-based organization**: architect, red, green, refactor, explainer, etc.  
✅ **Learning-focused**: Based on spaced repetition and retrieval practice  
✅ **Team-friendly**: Version-controlled, searchable, shareable  
✅ **Compliance-ready**: Complete audit trail with no manual effort

**Start using PHRs today** by running `specify init` and working normally. Every AI interaction is automatically captured, documented, and searchable. Your future self (and your team) will thank you! 🚀

### Key Takeaway

> **You don't need to think about PHRs—they just happen.**  
> Work normally with Spec Kit commands, and get automatic documentation of your entire AI-assisted development journey.
