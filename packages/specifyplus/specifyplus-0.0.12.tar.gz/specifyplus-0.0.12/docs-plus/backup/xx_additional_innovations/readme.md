# AI Playbook: Innovations

The AI-First Engineering Playbook is exceptionally thorough and captures the discipline required for production-grade agentic software. It's a fantastic blueprint.

Here are the targeted innovations to enhance the process, building directly on our existing foundation of rigor and traceability.

-----


### \#\# 1. Explicit Security & Adversarial Testing

AI agents introduce new attack surfaces, primarily through prompt injection. Your playbook should treat this as a first-class security threat with its own dedicated testing discipline.

**Introduce Adversarial PHRs:** Encourage developers to create **Prompt History Records** specifically for *breaking* the agent. This frames security testing as part of the core PDD loop, not an afterthought.

**Why it's an innovation:** It formalizes AI-specific security testing within the existing TDD/PDD framework, making the system resilient by design rather than by chance.

### \#\# 2. Cost & Performance Guardrails

Agentic systems can have unpredictable operational costs (token usage) and latency. Your playbook can be enhanced by making these metrics visible and enforceable throughout the development lifecycle.

**Why it's an innovation:** It shifts thinking from "does it work?" to "does it work **efficiently and affordably**?" This makes the engineering process directly accountable to business and operational constraints from the very first prompt. ðŸ’°

### \#\# 3. The "Review & Refine" Loop (Prompt Refactoring)

Your Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor loop is perfect for code. A parallel concept is needed for prompts, as the first "green" prompt is rarely the most robust or efficient one.

**How to integrate it:**

1.  **Formalize a "Refine" Step:** Augment the loop to **Red â†’ Green â†’ Refine â†’ Refactor**.
      * **Red:** Write failing test.
      * **Green:** Write a prompt to generate code that passes the test.
      * **Refine:** With the test passing, create a new PHR to *refine the previous prompt*. The goal is to make it clearer, more robust, or more concise while keeping the tests green. For example: "Refine the system prompt in `customer.py` to be more explicit about not giving financial advice, using the Flesch-Kincaid readability score as a guide. All existing tests must pass."
      * **Refactor:** Refactor the *generated code* for clarity and maintainability.
2.  **Link PHRs:** The "Refine" PHR should explicitly reference the "Green" PHR it improves upon. This creates a traceable history of prompt evolution, showing how an instruction was hardened over time.

**Why it's an innovation:** It acknowledges that **prompts are source code** and require the same discipline of refinement and maintenance as the code they generate. This prevents "prompt rot" and makes the system's core logic easier to understand and evolve.

### \#\# 4. AI-Assisted ADR Automation
   - **Description:** Leverage AI (e.g., via Cursor or GPT-5 Codex) to auto-draft ADRs by analyzing linked PHRs and commit diffs. The AI scans for decision patterns (e.g., "chose SSE over WS due to simplicity") and generates a structured draft, which you review and refine. Add a "ADR confidence score" based on how well options are balanced.
   - **Why innovate here?** ADRs are a key governance tool in your playbook, but writing them from scratch can slow momentum. Automation ensures consistency and captures tacit decisions that might otherwise go undocumented.
   - **Integration:** Add a new PHR stage ("ADR-Draft") after Green/Refactor. Use a Composer prompt to pull in PHR context, then commit the draft to `docs/adr/NNNN-draft.md` before finalizing.
   - **Benefits:** Higher ADR density (Â§14 metric); reduces bias by forcing AI to list pros/cons from multiple angles; easier for teams to maintain "decision debt" hygiene.
   - **Sample PHR Prompt (ADR-Draft Stage):**
     ```
     Auto-draft ADR for <decision-topic> based on PHR IDs <list>.
     - Context: Summarize from PHR outcomes and diffs.
     - Options: List 3+ alternatives with pros/cons (e.g., performance, complexity).
     - Decision: Recommend one; flag consequences.
     - References: Link PHRs, PRs, external rationale.
     Output: Full ADR markdown; highlight uncertainties for human review.
     ```
