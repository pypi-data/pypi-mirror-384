4. Composer automatically runs necessary terminal commands

## AI-Powered Development Workflow

### 1. Instant Code Generation

Instead of writing code, describe what you want:

**In any Python file, press `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` and type:**
```
Add a function that generates ASCII art text for any input string
```

Cursor will instantly generate the complete function with proper implementation.

### 2. Automatic Error Fixing

When you encounter an error:

1. The error appears in terminal
2. Press `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`
3. Type: "fix this error"
4. Cursor analyzes the error and fixes it automatically

```
"Initialize git, create a proper .gitignore, make initial commit with conventional commit message"
```

### Environment Setup
```
"Set up different uv environments for development, testing, and production with appropriate dependencies"
```

### Deployment
```
"Create Docker setup and deploy this to Google Cloud Run with GitHub Actions"
```

## Tips for Maximum Automation

### 1. Use Descriptive Prompts

Instead of:
```
"add a function"
```

Use:
```
"Add a function called create_rainbow_text that takes a string and returns it with each character in a different color using rich library, with proper type hints and docstring"
```

### 2. Chain Commands

In Cursor Chat, you can chain multiple operations:
```
1. Create a new feature branch
2. Implement user authentication with JWT
3. Add tests for the auth module
4. Create migration scripts
5. Update README with auth documentation
6. Commit with conventional commit message
7. Push to GitHub and create PR
```

### 3. Use Context References

Reference files and symbols directly:
```
@main.py Update the greet function to support @config.yaml settings and add the new languages from @locales.json
```

### 4. Leverage Tab Completion

- Start typing and press Tab for AI completions
- Works for:
  - Function implementations
  - Test cases
  - Documentation
  - Import statements
  - Error handling

### 5. Create Custom Commands

In Cursor Chat:
```
Create a Makefile with these commands:
- make install: Set up uv environment and install dependencies

- make format: Format code with black and isort
- make lint: Run all linters
- make run: Run the application
- make clean: Clean up generated files
- make docker: Build and run Docker container
- make deploy: Deploy to production

Then create a justfile as an alternative with the same commands
```

### 6. Batch Operations

Process multiple files at once:
```
For all Python files in src/:
1. Add comprehensive type hints
2. Add docstrings if missing
3. Optimize imports
4. Add logging statements
5. Ensure PEP 8 compliance
```

### 7. Smart Refactoring

```
Analyze the codebase and:
1. Identify code smells
2. Suggest design pattern improvements
3. Find duplicate code
4. Implement the DRY principle
5. Apply SOLID principles where needed
```
