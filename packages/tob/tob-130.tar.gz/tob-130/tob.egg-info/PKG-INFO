**DESCRIPTION**

TOB has all you need to program a unix cli program, such as disk
perisistence for configuration files, event handler to handle the
client/server connection, etc.

TOB contains python3 code to program objects in a functional
way. it provides an “clean namespace” Object class that only has
dunder methods, so the namespace is not cluttered with method names.
This makes storing and reading to/from json possible.
