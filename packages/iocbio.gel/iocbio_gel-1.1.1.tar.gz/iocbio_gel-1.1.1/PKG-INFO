# IOCBIO Gel: Software for Gel image analysis

IOCBIO Gel was originally developed for Western Blot gel image analysis. However, it can be used
for any sample analysis technique that would result in similar images where each sample is allocated
a "well" with the intensity of blobs in the wells corresponding to sample content. 

IOCBIO Gel is a free software released under the GNU General Public
License (GPL), see the file [`LICENSE`](LICENSE.md) for details.

See [IOCBIO Gel homepage](https://iocbio.gitlab.io/gel) for
brief description, links and installation instructions.
