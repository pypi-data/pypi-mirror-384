## About

CensusWrangler is the fast python interface to your local copy of the Australian Census data.

## The use-case

If you have any interest or career involving Australian data, you\'ve
likely had to deal with the challenging Census data structures.

In the government\'s interest of maintaining privacy for all involved,
they provide data as a series of hundreds of tables each at different
levels of geographic aggregation.

My experience has been that getting the right slice of data out this
structure can be tedious and time-consuming. It drags out what would
otherwise be a quick piece of adhoc analysis.

If you\'re lucky - your organisation already has a paid API, or database
of the census data. But if not?

You can speed up the process with the CensusWrangler library. With quick
& templatable configurations it helps you efficiently pull data out of
the downloadable census datapacks.

## Features

-   **Configuration templates**: Deploy and quickly customise
    configuration csvs - then let CensusWrangler instally find and merge
    the data
-   **Re-use configs across geographies**: Change a single argument to
    re-pull data from a different geography without any additional work
-   **Validation & Checks**: Your config is checked against census
    metadata, with detailed errors letting you know what went wrong
-   **Built-in Grouping**: Make easier for yourself down the line by
    setting groups and your own column naming directly in the config
    file
-   **Customisable output**: Select from several convenient output
    methods, accessing the output quickly in your desired format
-   **On you local machine**: Once you have downloaded the datapack, the
    library requires no access to anything other than what is on your
    local machine

## Set-up

### Download a census datapack

1.  Visit the the [ABS Census
    DataPacks](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/datapacks)
    page & download a datapack `.zip`
2.  Extract the `.zip` into a single folder, containing nothing else

When you are ready, your datapack folder should look something like
this, with the name of the downloaded pack:

```
/2021_GCP_all_for_AUS_short-header
    ├── 2021 Census GCP All Geographies for AUS/
    ├── Metadata/
    ├── Readme/
```

CensusWrangler is fully tested on the 2021 census datapacks, and basic testing shows it working with previous years as well.


### Install

``` 
pip install censuswrangler
```

### Import

``` python
import censuswrangler as cw
```

## Usage

### Preparing a Config Template

We tell CensusWrangler what data to grab by preparing a config `csv`:

#### Generate a config template

You can quickly generate a template to get started:

``` python
cw.create_config_template(r"C:\Config Folder\")
```

### Config fields

Below is an sample example of the config `csv`\`

The first 3 fields come straight from the metadata:

-   `SHORT` - Short descriptor
-   `LONG` - Long descriptor
-   `DATAPACKFILE` - A code indicating which datapack file contains the
    field

The other 2 are used to customise, group & simplify the names of fields
in the CensusWrangler output:

-   `CUSTOM_DESCRIPTION` - Describes the data subset represented, Like
    \'Male\' & \'Female\'
-   `CUSTOM_GROUP` - Describes the subsets, like \'Gender\'

Put whatever you need in the custom fields, just make sure that each row
is unique.


| SHORT | LONG | DATAPACKFILE | CUSTOM_DESCRIPTION | CUSTOM_GROUP | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tot_P\_M | Total_Persons_Males | G01 | Male  | Gender | 
| Tot_P\_F | Total_Persons_Females | G01 | Female  | Gender
| P_Tot_Marrd_reg_marrge | PERSONS_Total_Married_in_a\_registered_marriage | G06 | Married | Relationship Type |
| P_Tot_Married_de_facto | PERSONS_Total_Married_in_a\_de_facto_marriage | G06 | Couple | Relationship Type |
| P_Tot_Not_married | PERSONS_Total_Not_married | G06 | No relationship | Relationship Type |


### Referencing Metadata

It\'s super easy to copy what you want out of the metadata file that
comes with each datapack.

1.  In the datapack folder, look in the `/Metadata/` folder for a file
    like `Metadata_2021_GCP_DataPack_R1_R2.xlsx`
2.  Go to the `Cell Descriptors Information` sheet
3.  Browse the fields, and copy over the `SHORT`, `LONG` &
    `DATAPACKFILE` columns for your fields you want, into the config
    file
4.  Fill in the custom fields in the remaining columns of the config
    file

This file is also used to validate your config selections, so try &
avoiding changing it as you go.

### Select a Census Geography

Visit the ABS [Census Geography
Glossary](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/geography/census-geography-glossary).

Determine the shortcode for the geography you are after. For example,
\'Statistical Area Level 1\' has code \'SA1\'.

This is also reflected by the folder names in the datapack - look for
the name like `\2021 Census GCP All Geographies for AUS\`.

## Usage

Once the config file is ready, you can run CensusWrangler with just a
few lines of code:

``` python
import censuswrangler as cw

# Intialise the Census object
census = cw.Census(
    datapack_path=r"E:/Data/2021_GCP_all_for_AUS_short-header/",  # Datapack folder path
    config_path=r"censuswrangler/config_template.csv",  # Config file path
    geo_type="LGA",  # The geotype code to pull the data for
    year=2021,  # The census year
)

# Gather and prepare the data from the datapack
census.wrangle("all")  # "merge" | "pivot" | "all"

# Access the output dataframes in the desired format
print(census.merged_df)
print(census.pivoted_df)

# Or output directly to csv
census.to_csv(
    "all",  # "merge" | "pivot" | "all"
    r"F:/Github/censuswrangler/test_output",  # Output folder
)
```

More details are available in the [documentation](www.google.com).

## Example Output

You can see example output over in the repository\'s [sample
folder](https://github.com/Kyle-Ross/censuswrangler/tree/main/samples).

Good luck - and don\'t forget to give the [repository](https://github.com/Kyle-Ross/censuswrangler) a star if this helped you out (it all helps!).
