üß† Constructional Diversity Analyzer (CDA)
	The Constructional Diversity Analyzer (CDA) is a tool designed to measure the constructional diversity, constructional complexity, and verbal diversity of English texts.


‚ú® Features
	CDA outputs various scores for the following indices.

	(1) Constructional diversity: Calculates root TTR (RTTR; Guiraud, 1960), Herdan‚Äôs C (or log TTR; Chotlos, 1944; Herdan, 1960), Maas‚Äô score (Maas, 1972), moving-average type-token ratio (MATTR; Covington & McFall, 2010), hypergeometric distribution diversity index (HD-D; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2007), measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD-Original; McCarthy, 2005; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010), moving-average bidirectional measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD-MA-BI; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010), and moving-average wrapped measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD-WRAP; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010) based on constructions.

	(2) Constructional Complexity: Calculates the mean number of dependents as well as modifiers per construction.

	(3) Verbal Diversity: Calculates root TTR (RTTR; Guiraud, 1960), Herdan‚Äôs C (or log TTR; Chotlos, 1944; Herdan, 1960), Maas‚Äô score (Maas, 1972), moving-average type-token ratio (MATTR; Covington & McFall, 2010), hypergeometric distribution diversity index (HD-D; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2007), measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD-Original; McCarthy, 2005; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010), moving-average bidirectional measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD-MA-BI; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010), and moving-average wrapped measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD-WRAP; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010) based on verbs.


üìö Construction Types
	CDA identifies and analyzes the following constructions:

	(1) Attributive construction
	(2) Caused motion construction
	(3) Ditransitive construction
	(4) Intransitive motion construction
	(5) Intransitive resultative construction
	(6) Passive construction
	(7) Simple-intransitive construction
	(8) Simple-transitive construction
	(9) There-expletive construction
	(10) Transitive resultative construction
