class DFMFImputer(DFMF):
    r"""
    Impute missing data in a dataset using the `DFMF` method. [#dfmfpaper]_ [#dfmfcode]_

    This class extends the `DFMF` class to provide functionality for filling in incomplete samples by
    addressing both block-wise and feature-wise missing data. As a subclass of DFMF, `DFMFImputer` inherits all
    input parameters and attributes from `DFMF`. Consequently, it uses the same `fit` method as DFMF for
    training the model.
