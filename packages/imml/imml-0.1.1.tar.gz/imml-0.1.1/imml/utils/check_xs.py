def check_Xs(Xs, enforce_modalities=None, copy=False, ensure_all_finite="allow-nan",return_dimensions=False):
    r"""
    Checks Xs and ensures it to be a list of 2D matrices. Adapted from `Ì€mvlearn` [#checkxspaper]_ [#checkxscode]_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    Xs : list of array-likes objects
        - Xs length: n_mods
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)

        A list of different modalities.
    enforce_modalities : int, (default=not checked)
        If provided, ensures this number of modalities in Xs. Otherwise not checked.
    copy : boolean, (default=False)
        If True, the returned Xs is a copy of the input Xs, and operations on the output will not affect the input.
        If False, the returned Xs is a modality of the input Xs, and operations on the output will change the input.
    ensure_all_finite : bool or 'allow-nan', default='allow-nan'
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf, np.nan, pd.NA in array. The possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of array to be finite.
        - False: accepts np.inf, np.nan, pd.NA in array.
        - 'allow-nan': accepts only np.nan and pd.NA values in array. Values
          cannot be infinite.
    return_dimensions : boolean, (default=False)
        If True, the function also returns the dimensions of the multi-modal dataset. The dimensions are n_mods,
        n_samples, n_features where n_samples and n_mods are respectively the number of modalities and the number of
        samples, and n_features is a list of length n_mods containing the number of features of each modality.
