        Parameters
        ----------
        system: tuple[freud.box.Box, np.ndarray]
            A ``freud`` system-like object. Common examples include a tuple of
            a `freud.box.Box` and a `numpy.ndarray` of positions and a
            `gsd.hoomd.Frame`.
        neighbors: freud.locality.NeighborList | freud.locality.NeighborQuery
            A ``freud`` neighbor query object. Defines neighbors for the system.
            Weights provided by a neighbor list are currently unused.
        query_points: np.ndarray | None, optional
            The points to compute the BOOSOP for. Defaults to ``None`` which
            computes the BOOSOP for all points in the system. The shape should be
            ``(N_p, 3)`` where ``N_p`` is the number of points.
        l: `int`, optional
            The spherical harmonic l to use for the bond order functions calculation.
            Increasing ``l`` increases the accuracy of the bond order calculation at the
            cost of performance. The sweet spot number which is high enough for all
            point groups and gives reasonable accuracy for relatively high number of
            neighbors is 10. Point group O needs ``l`` of at least 9 and T needs at
            least 8. Lower values increase speed. Defaults to 10.
        m: `int`, optional
            The number of points to use in the longitudinal direction for
            spherical Gauss-Legrende quadrature. Defaults to 10. We recommend ``m`` to
            be equal or larger than l. More concentrated distributions require larger
            ``m`` to properly evaluate bond order functions. The number of points to
            evaluate scales as :math:`4 m^2`.
        refine: `bool`, optional
            Whether to recompute the BOOSOP after optimizing. Defaults to
            ``False``. This is used to enable a higher fidelity calculation
            after a lower fidelity optimization. If used the ``refine_l`` and
            ``refine_m`` should be set to a higher value than ``l`` and ``m``. Make sure
            ``max_l`` is higher or equal to ``refine_l``.
        refine_l: `int`, optional
            The maximum spherical harmonic l to use for refining. Defaults
            to 10.
        refine_m: `int`, optional
            The number of points to use in the longitudinal direction for
            spherical Gauss-Legrende quadrature in refining. Defaults to 10. More
            concentrated distributions require larger ``m`` to properly evaluate
            bond order functions. The number of points to evaluate scales as
            :math:`4 m^2`.

        mode : str, optional

        sigmas: np.ndarray | float
            The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution for each particle for
            mode "full". If mode is "boo", the kappa parameter for the von-Mises-Fisher.
            Note that for gaussian distribution, smaller sigma values are more

            Fisher distribution, smaller kappa values are more spread out and larger
            kappa values are more concentrated.
            If a float is passed, the same value is used for all particles. If `None` is
            passed, sigma is determined as the value at which the gaussian function
            value evaluated at half of the smallest bond distance has 25% height of max
