            The distribution to use. Either "fisher" for the von-Mises-Fisher
            distribution or "uniform" for a uniform distribution.
        symmetries : list[str]
            A list of point groups to test each particles' neighborhood. Uses
            Schoenflies notation and is case sensitive. Options are

            :math:`S_n`, :math:`D_n`, :math:`D_{nh}`, :math:`D_{nd}`, :math:`T`,
            :math:`T_h`, :math:`T_d`, :math:`O`, :math:`O_h`, :math:`I`, :math:`I_h`.
            Replace :math:`n` with an integer, and pass them as strings, e.g.,
            ``["C3", "D6h"]``.
        optimizer : spatula.optimize.Optimizer
            An optimizer to optimize the rotation of the particle's local
            neighborhoods.
        max_l : `int`, optional
            The maximum spherical harmonic l to use for computations. This number should
            be larger than the ``l`` and ``refine_l`` used in ``compute``. Defaults to
            10.
        kappa : float
            The concentration parameter for the von-Mises-Fisher distribution.
            Only used when ``dist`` is "fisher". This number should be roughly equal to
            average number of neighbors. If neighborhood is more dense (has more
            neighbors) higher values are recommended. Should be larger than ``l`` for
            good accuracy. Defaults to 11.5.
        max_theta : float
            The maximum angle (in radians) that the uniform distribution
            extends. Only used when ``dist`` is uniform. Defaults to 0.61

        Note
        ----
            Higher ``max_l`` requires higher ``m``. A rough equality is usually

            though setting ``m`` to 1 to 2 higher often still improves results.

        Parameters
        ----------
        system: tuple[freud.box.Box, np.ndarray]
            A ``freud`` system-like object. Common examples include a tuple of
            a `freud.box.Box` and a `numpy.ndarray` of positions and a
            `gsd.hoomd.Frame`.
        neighbors: freud.locality.NeighborList | freud.locality.NeighborQuery
            A ``freud`` neighbor query object. Defines neighbors for the system.
            Weights provided by a neighbor list are currently unused.
        query_points: np.ndarray | None, optional
            The points to compute the BOOSOP for. Defaults to ``None`` which
            computes the BOOSOP for all points in the system. The shape should be
            ``(N_p, 3)`` where ``N_p`` is the number of points.
        l: `int`, optional
            The spherical harmonic l to use for the bond order functions calculation.
            Increasing ``l`` increases the accuracy of the bond order calculation at the
            cost of performance. The sweet spot number which is high enough for all
            point groups and gives reasonable accuracy for relatively high number of
            neighbors is 10. Point group O needs ``l`` of at least 9 and T needs at
            least 8. Lower values increase speed. Defaults to 10.
        m: `int`, optional
            The number of points to use in the longitudinal direction for
            spherical Gauss-Legrende quadrature. Defaults to 10. We recommend ``m`` to
            be equal or larger than l. More concentrated distributions require larger
            ``m`` to properly evaluate bond order functions. The number of points to
            evaluate scales as :math:`4 m^2`.
        refine: `bool`, optional
            Whether to recompute the BOOSOP after optimizing. Defaults to
            ``False``. This is used to enable a higher fidelity calculation
            after a lower fidelity optimization. If used the ``refine_l`` and
            ``refine_m`` should be set to a higher value than ``l`` and ``m``. Make sure
            ``max_l`` is higher or equal to ``refine_l``.
        refine_l: `int`, optional
            The maximum spherical harmonic l to use for refining. Defaults
            to 10.
        refine_m: `int`, optional
            The number of points to use in the longitudinal direction for
            spherical Gauss-Legrende quadrature in refining. Defaults to 10. More
            concentrated distributions require larger ``m`` to properly evaluate
            bond order functions. The number of points to evaluate scales as
            :math:`4 m^2`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        system: tuple[freud.box.Box, np.ndarray]
            A ``freud`` system-like object. Common examples include a tuple of
            a `freud.box.Box` and a `numpy.ndarray` of positions and a
            `gsd.hoomd.Frame`.
        sigmas: np.ndarray | float
            The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution for each particle for
            mode "full". If mode is "boo", the kappa parameter for the von-Mises-Fisher.
            Note that for gaussian distribution, smaller sigma values are more
            concentrated and larger sigma values are more spread out. For von-Mises-
            Fisher distribution, smaller kappa values are more spread out and larger
            kappa values are more concentrated.
            If a float is passed, the same value is used for all particles. If `None` is
            passed, sigma is determined as the value at which the gaussian function
            value evaluated at half of the smallest bond distance has 25% height of max
            gaussian height for the same sigma for the "full" mode. In the "boo" mode,
            the default value is 15.0.
        neighbors: freud.locality.NeighborList | freud.locality.NeighborQuery | dict
            Neighbors used for the computation. If a `freud.locality.NeighborList` is
            passed, the neighbors are used directly (in this case ``query_points``
            should not be given as they are ignored). If a
            `freud.locality.NeighborQuery` is passed, the neighbors are computed using
            the query (working in conjunction with query points). If a dictionary is
            used it should be used as freud's neighbor query dictionary (can also be
            used in conjunction with ``query_points``).
        query_points : np.ndarray | None, optional
