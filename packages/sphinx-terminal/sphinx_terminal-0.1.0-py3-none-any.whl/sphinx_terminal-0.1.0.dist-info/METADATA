# sphinx-terminal

sphinx-terminal allows you to display terminal input and output in your Sphinx
documentation.

## Basic usage

To display terminal input and output in your rST document, use the `terminal` directive,
providing input and output as follows:

```
.. terminal::
    :input: echo 'hello'

        hello
    :input: echo 'goodbye'

        goodbye

```

The prompt defaults to `user@host:~$`. To customize this, use the `:user:`, `:host:`,
and `:dir:` options.

```
.. terminal::
    :user: author
    :host: canonical
    :dir: ~/path
    :input: echo 'hello'

        hello

```

To enable a copy button for users, include the `:copy:` flag as a directive option.

```
.. terminal::
    :copy:
    :input: echo 'hello'

        hello

```

Similarly, to make the output scrollable, include the `:scroll:` flag as a directive option.

```
.. terminal::
    :scroll:
    :input: echo 'hello'

        hello

```

## Project setup

sphinx-terminal is published on PyPI and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install sphinx-terminal
```

After adding sphinx-terminal to your Python project, update your Sphinx's conf.py file
to include sphinx-terminal as one of its extensions:

```python
extensions = [
    "sphinx_terminal"
]
```
