# Settings

## QUEUEBIE_APP_BASE_PATH

Queuebie needs to know where your project lives to detect local Django apps. It defaults to `settings.BASE_PATH`
but you can overwrite it with a string or a `Pathlib` object.

```python
from pathlib import Path

QUEUEBIE_APP_BASE_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve(strict=True).parent
```

## QUEUEBIE_CACHE_KEY

Queuebie will cache all detected message handlers in Django's default cache. The default cache key is "queuebie".
You can overwrite it with this variable.

```python
QUEUEBIE_CACHE_KEY = "my_very_special_cache_key"
```

## QUEUEBIE_LOGGER_NAME

Queuebie defines a Django logger with the default name "queuebie". If you want to rename that logger, you can set this
variable.

```python
QUEUEBIE_LOGGER_NAME = "my_very_special_logger"
```

Take care to use the same name in the logging configuration in your Django settings.

## QUEUEBIE_STRICT_MODE

Queuebie enforces by default that commands are not used outside its domain (aka Django app) and event handlers don't
talk to the database. If you want to skip that restriction for whatever reason, you can do so.

```python
QUEUEBIE_STRICT_MODE = False
```
