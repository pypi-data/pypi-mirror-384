A simple and synchronous message queue for commands and events for Django.

[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-queuebie/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ambient-innovation/django-queuebie) | [Full documentation](https://django-queuebie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Creator & Maintainer: [Ambient Digital](https://ambient.digital/)

## Features

* Split up your business logic in commands and events
* Commands are imperatives telling your system what to do, events reflect that something has happened
* Register light-weight functions via a decorator to listen to your commands and events
* Message handlers receive the context of the message (command or event), providing an explicit API
* No magic, no side effects since the queue works synchronously

```python
import dataclasses

from queuebie.runner import handle_message
from queuebie.messages import Command, Event
from queuebie import message_registry


# Example command
@dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)
class BuyProduct(Command):
    product_id: int
    customer_id: int
    price: float
    currency: str


# Example event
@dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)
class ProductBought(Event):
    product_id: int
    customer_id: int


# Example handler
@message_registry.register_command(BuyProduct)
def handle_buy_product(context: BuyProduct) -> Event:
    # Here lives your business logic

    return ProductBought(
        product_id=context.product_id,
        customer_id=context.customer_id,
    )


# Start queue and process messages
handle_message(
    BuyProduct(
        product_id=product.id,
        customer_id=customer.id,
        price=12.99,
        currency="EUR",
    )
)
```

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install django_queuebie`

  or via uv:

  `uv add django_queuebie`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    "queuebie",
)
```

### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

- Fetch the latest changes in GitHub mirror and push them
- Trigger new build at ReadTheDocs.io (follow instructions in admin panel at RTD) if the GitHub webhook is not yet set
  up.

### Preparation and building

This package uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and building.

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `CHANGES.md`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to "main"

- This project uses uv to publish to PyPI. This will create distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

  ```bash
  uv build
  ```

### Publishing to PyPI

To publish to the production PyPI:

```bash
uv publish
```

To publish to TestPyPI first (recommended for testing):

```bash
uv publish --publish-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

You can then test the installation from TestPyPI:

```bash
uv pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ambient-package-update
```

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. This updater is rendering all important
configuration and setup files. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
