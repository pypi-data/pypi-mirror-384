class SharedMemoryArray:
    """Wraps a NumPy n-dimensional array object and exposes methods for accessing the array's data from multiple
    different Python processes.

    During initialization, this class creates a persistent memory buffer to which it connects from different Python
    processes. The data inside the buffer is accessed via an n-dimensional NumPy array with optional locking to prevent
    race conditions.

    Notes:
        This class should only be instantiated inside the main runtime thread via the create_array() method. Do not
        attempt to instantiate the class manually. All child processes working with this class should use the connect()
        method to connect to the shared array wrapped by the class before calling any other method.

        Shared memory buffers are garbage-collected differently depending on the host Operating System. On Windows,
        garbage collection is handed off to the OS and cannot be enforced manually. On Unix (macOS and Linux), the
        buffer can be garbage-collected by calling the destroy() method.

    Args:
        name: The unique name to use for the shared memory buffer.
        shape: The shape of the NumPy array used to access the data in the shared memory buffer.
        datatype: The datatype of the NumPy array used to access the data in the shared memory buffer.
        buffer: The SharedMemory buffer that stores the shared data.

    Attributes:
        _name: Stores the name of the shared memory buffer.
        _shape: Stores the shape of the NumPy array used to access the buffered data.
        _datatype: Stores the datatype of the NumPy array used to access the buffered data.
        _buffer: Stores the Shared Memory buffer object.
        _lock: Stores the Lock object used to prevent multiple processes from working with the shared data at the same
            time.
        _array: Stores the NumPy array used to interface with the data stored in the shared memory buffer.
        _connected: Tracks whether the instance is connected to the shared memory buffer.
        _destroy_buffer: Tracks whether the shared memory buffer should be destroyed if this instance is
            garbage-collected.
