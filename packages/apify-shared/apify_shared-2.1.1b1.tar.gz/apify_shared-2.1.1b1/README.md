# Apify Shared Python

The `apify-shared-python` is a Python library for containing constants and utilities which are used across
our other Python projects like [apify-client-python](https://github.com/apify/apify-client-python)
and [apify-sdk-python](https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-python).

If you want to develop Apify Actors in Python,
check out the [Apify SDK for Python](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python) instead.
