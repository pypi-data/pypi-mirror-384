## Requirements

### Dev

Poetry, python 3.12

### Users

python >= 3.12

## Installation

`pip install lparchive2epub`

`pipx install lparchive2epub`

A standalone executable is available for releases on windows. See the releases page.

## Known limitations

- ~~Similar images present in multiple pages in the let's play are duplicated, bloating the file. Though recurring images are usually smileys, so not too big.~~ Now handled!
- ~~Links to images are not properly saved.~~ Now working properly!
- LPs that are mostly link to YouTube videos are not very interesting to transform to epub
- Some LPs completely fail to be downloaded.
