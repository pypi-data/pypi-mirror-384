# Hypothese 

We suppose the user has access to a Linux environment or whatever OS with Python3 installed.
The examples are provided with Python v3.12 . 

Good practices propose to use a Python virtual environment for a project. 
This env allows to install/manipulate packages, pre-requisite isolated from core OS installation. 

## we create a virtual env nammed py3nm , an alias to activate it  
$ python3.12 -m venv py3nm   
$ alias py3nm="source $HOME/py3nm/bin/activate"  
## we enter this env  ( deactivate to leave ) 
$ py3nm 
(py3nm) $ pip3 install --upgrade pip  ## to benefit from last version 

## we install nawalny and dependencies from pip repostory
(py3nm) $ pip3 install nawalny 

The required packages to work with NMB2 api should have been installed :
. zeep, to address Request/Reply in Soap/Xml,  
. python-qpid-proton , to address Publish/Subscribe in Amqp 1.0 . 

Few other packages are installed during the process. 
You can list them on your system, the list below with state version is dated May 2025 ; 

(py3nm) $ pip3 list

Once you have got your NMB2B certificate usable, 2 files are expected with .pem extension :
eg. crt.pem, key.pem - stored at your disposal -  you can test your environment.

Find where the examples files have been installed, it could be :
$HOME/py3nm/lib64/python3.12/site-packages/nawalny/examples/.

Copy the template.conf to your working directory - WD ,  $WD/my.conf . 

You should edit $WD/my.conf and populate : 

{   'swsdlpath': "path where you store Eurocontrol/NMB2B api file : .xsd .wsdl ", 
    'nmcontext': "PREOPS", 
    'nmapiindex': "27.0.0",
    'nmcertpath' : "path to your cert .pem file",
    'nmkeypath'  : "path to your key .pem file " ,
    'nmpassword' : None  
# could be a protection password for your key or None if the key is not cyphered 
} 
A very reduced subset of api definition file is provided in the examples directory:
CommonServices_27.0.0.xsd  GeneralinformationServices_27.0.0.xsd GeneralinformationServices_PREOPS_27.0.0.wsdl
they are sufficient to launch the tester. 

The use of nawalny_rr_selftest.py should be straightforward once copied in your WD. 
./nawalny_rr_selftest.py --conf=$WD/my.conf 

Here we go a.
