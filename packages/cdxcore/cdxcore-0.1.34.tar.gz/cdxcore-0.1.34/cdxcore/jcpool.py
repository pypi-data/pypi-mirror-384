"""
Simple multi-processing conv wrapper around (already great)
`joblib.Parallel() <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.Parallel.html>`__.

The minor additions are that parallel processing will be a tad more convenient for dictionaries,
and that it supports routing :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context` messaging via a
:class:`multiprocessing.Queue` to a single thread.

    Parallel Job Context Pool.
    
    Simple wrapper around `joblib.Parallel() <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.Parallel.html>`__ 
    which allows worker processes to use :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context` to report
    progress updates. For this purpose, :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context` 
    will send output messages via a :class:`multiprocessing.Queue`
    to the main process
    where a sepeate thread prints these messages out.
    
    Using a fixed central pool object in  your code base
    avoids relaunching processes.

    Functions passed to :meth:`cdxcore.jcpool.JCPool.parallel` and related functions must
    be decorated with :dec:`cdxcore.jcpool.JCPool.delayed`.

    **List/Generator Usage**

    The following code is a standard prototype for using :func:`cdxcore.jcpool.JCPool.parallel`
    following closely the `joblib paradigm <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html>`__:

    .. code-block:: python

        from cdxcore.verbose import Context
        from cdxcore.jcpool import JCPool
        import time as time 
        import numpy as np

        pool    = JCPool( num_workers=4 )   # global pool. Reuse where possible
        
        def f( ticker, tdata, verbose : Context ):
            # some made up function
            q  = np.quantile( tdata, 0.35, axis=0 )
            tx = q[0]
            ty = q[1]
            time.sleep(0.5)
            verbose.write(f"Result for {ticker}: {tx:.2f}, {ty:.2f}")
            return tx, ty
        
        tickerdata =\
         { 'SPY': np.random.normal(size=(1000,2)),
           'GLD': np.random.normal(size=(1000,2)), 
           'BTC': np.random.normal(size=(1000,2))
         } 
        
        verbose = Context("all")
        with verbose.write_t("Launching analysis") as tme:
            with pool.context( verbose ) as verbose:
                for tx, ty in pool.parallel(
                            pool.delayed(f)( ticker=ticker, tdata=tdata, verbose=verbose(2) )
                            for ticker, tdata in tickerdata.items() ):
                    verbose.report(1,f"Returned {tx:.2f}, {ty:.2f}")
        verbose.write(f"Analysis done; this took {tme}.")
    
    The output from this code is asynchronous:

    .. code-block:: python

        00: Launching analysis
        02:     Result for SPY: -0.43, -0.39
        01:   Returned -0.43, -0.39
        02:     Result for BTC: -0.39, -0.45
        01:   Returned -0.39, -0.45
        02:     Result for GLD: -0.41, -0.43
        01:   Returned -0.41, -0.43
        00: Analysis done; this took 0.73s.        

    **Dict**

    Considering the asynchronous nature of the returned data it is often desirable
    to keep track of results by some identifier. In above example ``ticker``
    was not available in the main loop.
    This pattern is automated with the dictionary usage pattern:
    
    .. code-block:: python
       :emphasize-lines: 26,27,28,29

        from cdxcore.verbose import Context
        from cdxcore.jcpool import JCPool
        import time as time 
        import numpy as np

        pool    = JCPool( num_workers=4 )   # global pool. Reuse where possible
        
        def f( ticker, tdata, verbose : Context ):
            # some made up function
            q  = np.quantile( tdata, 0.35, axis=0 )
            tx = q[0]
            ty = q[1]
            time.sleep(0.5)
            verbose.write(f"Result for {ticker}: {tx:.2f}, {ty:.2f}")
            return tx, ty
        
        tickerdata =\
         { 'SPY': np.random.normal(size=(1000,2)),
           'GLD': np.random.normal(size=(1000,2)), 
           'BTC': np.random.normal(size=(1000,2))
         } 
        
        verbose = Context("all")
        with verbose.write_t("Launching analysis") as tme:
            with pool.context( verbose ) as verbose:
                for ticker, tx, ty in pool.parallel(
                        { ticker: pool.delayed(f)( ticker=ticker, tdata=tdata, verbose=verbose(2) )
                          for ticker, tdata in tickerdata.items() } ):
            verbose.report(1,f"Returned {ticker} {tx:.2f}, {ty:.2f}")
        verbose.write(f"Analysis done; this took {tme}.")
    
    This generates the following output::

        00: Launching analysis
        02:     Result for SPY: -0.34, -0.41
        01:   Returned SPY -0.34, -0.41
        02:     Result for GLD: -0.38, -0.41
        01:   Returned GLD -0.38, -0.41
        02:     Result for BTC: -0.34, -0.32
        01:   Returned BTC -0.34, -0.32
        00: Analysis done; this took 5s.
    
    Note that :func:`cdxcore.jcpool.JCPool.parallel` when applied to a dictionary does not return a dictionary,
    but a sequence of tuples.
    As in the example this also works if the function being called returns tuples itself; in this case the returned data
    is extended by the key of the dictionary provided.
    
    In order to retrieve a dictionary use :func:`cdxcore.jcpool.JCPool.parallel_to_dict`::

        verbose = Context("all")
        with pool.context( verbose ) as verbose:
            r = pool.parallel_to_dict( { ticker: pool.delayed(f)( ticker=ticker, tdata=tdata, verbose=verbose )
                                         for ticker, tdata in self.data.items() } )

    Note that in this case the function returns only after all jobs have been processed.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
        num_workers : int, optional
            
            The number of workers. If ``num_workers`` is ``1`` then no parallel process or thread is started.
            Just as for `joblib <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.Parallel.html>`__ you can
            use a negative ``num_workers`` to set the number of workers to the ``number of CPUs + num_workers + 1``.
            For example, a ``num_workers`` of ``-2`` will use as many jobs as CPUs are present less one.
            If ``num_workers`` is negative, the effective number of workers will be at least ``1``.
            
            Default is ``1``.
        
        threading : bool, optional
        
            If ``False``, the default, then the pool will act as a ``"loky"`` multi-process pool with the associated overhead
            of managing data accross processes.
            
            If ``True``, then the pool is a ``"threading"`` pool. This helps for functions whose code releases
            Python's `global interpreter lock <https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock>`__, for example
            when engaged in heavy I/O or compiled code such as :mod:`numpy`., :mod:`pandas`,
            or generated with `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`__.
            
        tmp_root_dir : str | SubDir, optional
        
            Temporary directory for memory mapping large arrays. This is a root directory; the function
            will create a temporary sub-directory with a name generated from the current state of the system.
            This sub-directory will be deleted upon destruction of ``JCPool`` or when :meth:`cdxcore.jcpool.JCPool.terminate`
            is called.
            
            This parameter can also be ``None`` in which case the `default behaviour <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.Parallel.html>`__
            of :class:`joblib.Parallel` is used.
            
            Default is ``"!/.cdxmp"``.
            
        verbose : Context, optional
            
            A :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context` object used to print out multi-processing/threading information.
            This is *not* the ``Context`` provided to child processes/threads.
            
            Default is ``quiet``.

        parallel_kwargs : dict, optional
        
            Additional keywords for :class:`joblib.Parallel`.
