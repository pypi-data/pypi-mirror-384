"""
This module provides an interface to the sqloxide library, which is responsible for parsing SQL,
restoring the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and performing various mutations on expressions and relations.

For more information about sqloxide: https://github.com/wseaton/sqloxide

This module is not from sqloxide, it is written for Opteryx.
