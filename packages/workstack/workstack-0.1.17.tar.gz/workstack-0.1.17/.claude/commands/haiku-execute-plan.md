## Executing Implementation Plan

I'll now execute the implementation plan from `.PLAN.md` at the project root using the haiku-plan-executor agent.

First, let me read the plan to understand what needs to be implemented:

```bash
cat .PLAN.md
```

Once I've reviewed the plan, I'll use the haiku-plan-executor agent to execute it systematically.

**AGENT INVOCATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Read `.PLAN.md` from the project root** to get the full implementation plan
2. **Invoke the haiku-plan-executor agent** with the plan contents as context
3. **Provide the agent with**:
   - The full contents of `.PLAN.md`
   - Clear instruction to execute the plan step-by-step
   - Reminder to follow Workstack coding standards from CLAUDE.md

The agent prompt should be:

"Execute the implementation plan from .PLAN.md. Here is the plan content:

[Include the full content of .PLAN.md here]

Follow this plan step-by-step, implementing each phase in order. Ensure all code follows the Workstack coding standards defined in CLAUDE.md, particularly:

- NEVER use try/except for control flow
- Use Python 3.13+ type syntax
- Check path.exists() before resolve operations
- Use absolute imports only

Report progress as you complete each phase."
