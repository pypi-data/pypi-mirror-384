`traccuracy` provides a suite of benchmarking functions that can be used to evaluate cell tracking solutions against ground truth annotations. The goal of this library is to provide a convenient way to run rigorous evaluation and to document and consolidate the wide variety of metrics used in the field.

`traccuracy` can compute a comprehensive set of metrics for evaluating cell linking and division performance, and can compute biologically meaningful metrics such as the number of correctly reconstructed lineages over N frames and cell cycle length accuracy. As matching ground truth and predicted lineages is a crucial step for performing evaluation, `traccuracy` includes a number of algorithms for matching ground truth and predicted lineages, both with and without segmentation masks.

## Installation
`pip install traccuracy`

## How It Works
The `traccuracy` library has three main components: loaders, matchers, and metrics.

Loaders load tracking graphs from other formats, such as the CTC format, into a [TrackingGraph](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/traccuracy/index.html#traccuracy.TrackingGraph) object.
A `TrackingGraph` is a spatiotemporal graph backed by a `networkx.DiGraph`
Nodes represent a single cell in a given time point, and are annotated with a time and a location.
Edges point forward in time from a node representing a cell in time point `t` to the same cell or its daughter in frame `t+1` (or beyond, to represent skip edges). Additional terminology is documented in the [glossary](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html)
To load `TrackingGraph`s from a custom format, you will likely need to implement a loader: see
documentation [here](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/traccuracy/loaders/index.html#module-traccuracy.loaders) for more information. Alternatively you can initialize a `TrackingGraph` with a `networkx.DiGraph` and `ArrayLike` objects of segmentation masks if needed. 

Matchers take a ground truth and a predicted `TrackingGraph` with optional segmentation masks and match the nodes and edges to allow evaluation to occur. A list of matchers is available [here](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers/matchers.html).

In order to compute metrics, `traccuracy` begins by annotating the matched graphs with error flags such as False Positive and False Negative. The annotated graph can be exported and used for visualization in other tools. Finally, metrics inspect the error annotations to report both error counts and summary statistics. 

The `traccuracy` library has a flexible Python API, shown in [this](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/ctc.html) example notebook. Additionally there is a command line interface for running standard CTC metrics, [documented here](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html).

```python
from traccuracy.loaders import load_ctc_data
from traccuracy.matchers import PointMatcher
from traccuracy.metrics import DivisionMetrics, BasicMetrics

# Load data in TrackingGraph objects
gt_data = load_ctc_data(
    "path/to/GT/TRA",
    "path/to/GT/TRA/man_track.txt",
    name="GT"
)
pred_data = load_ctc_data(
    "path/to/prediction",
    "path/to/prediction/track.txt",
    name="prediction"
)

results, matched = run_metrics(
    gt_data=gt_data,
    pred_data=pred_data,
    matcher=PointMatcher(),
    metrics=[DivisionMetrics(), BasicMetrics()]
)
```
