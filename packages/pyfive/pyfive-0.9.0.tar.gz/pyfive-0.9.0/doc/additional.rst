Additional API Features
*********************** 

In this section we highlight the additional API features and optimisations that ``pyfive`` provides beyond the standard ``h5py`` functionality.

Datasets (aka "variables") are actually implemented as ``pyfive.h5d.DatasetID`` objects. The ``pyfive.h5d.DatasetID`` class is  designed to both support the same API as ``h5py.DatasetID`` and to 
provide additional functionality.

The autogenerated documentation identifies both the methods and attributes that are part of the ``h5py`` API and those that are extensions provided by ``pyfive``.
