pyfive : A pure Python HDF5 file reader
=======================================

pyfive is an open source library for reading HDF5 files written using
pure Python (no C extensions). The package is still in development and not all
features of HDF5 files are supported.

pyfive aims to support the same API as [`h5py`](https://github.com/h5py/h5py)
for reading files. Cases where a file uses a feature that is supported by `h5py`
but not pyfive are considered bug and should be reported in our [Issues](https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/pyfive/issues).
Writing HDF5 is not a goal of pyfive and portions of the API which apply only to writing will not be
implemented.

pyfive is tested to work with Python 3.10 to 3.13.  It may also work
with other Python versions.
