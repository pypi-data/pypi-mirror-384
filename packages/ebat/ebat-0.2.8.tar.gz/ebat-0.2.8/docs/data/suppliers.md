# EbatDataset

## Overview

The EbatDataset class represents a dataset for behavioral biometrics, containing input data X and corresponding labels
y. It is extended from torch.utils.data and behaves as any other PyTorch Dataset. All EBAT suppliers should supply
datasets as EbatDataset-s.

# Supplier

## Overview

The Supplier class serves as an abstract base class for data suppliers, providing a common interface for loading and
splitting datasets. This class should be extended when integrating new datasets into EBAT.

## Methods

### load_datasets

Abstract Method Loads the datasets according to the given configuration. Must be implemented by child classes. The split
between train, validation, testing, and adversarial datasets is dataset-dependent. Nevertheless, it should follow
standard machine learning practices to prevent data leakage. Furthermore, the testing and adversarial parts should come
from different users that performed experiments under equivalent conditions.

### fetch_and_split_identification

Returns the training, validation, test, and adversarial datasets for identification. The four sets here are identical to
the data loaded by _load_datasets_ method.

### fetch_and_split_verification

Returns the training, validation, test, and adversarial datasets for verification, with the specified authentication
user. The four sets are balanced between the positive (auth\_user) and negative (everyone else) class.

### fetch_and_split_authentication

Returns the training, validation, test, and adversarial datasets for authentication. First three sets are identical to
the _fetch\_and\_split\_identification_. Adversarial set however, consists of both testing and adversarial datasets,
where the two are merged and relabelled with a new binary ground truth â€” legitimate or adversarial data.

### fetch_and_split_session_takeover_attack

It works with identification, verification, and authentication and returns the same training, validation, and
adversarial datasets. The testing dataset instead consists of a single session takeover attack data. The attack itself
is constructed from a first half of a testing session of one of the legitimate users and a second half of testing
session data from one of the attackers.

# MedbaSupplier

## Overview

The MedbaSupplier class is a concrete implementation of the Supplier interface, providing datasets from the Medba
data collection. We collected this dataset by ourselves as a part of our previous efforts, therefore, it downloads
automatically if EBAT does not detect it in the appropriate directory. For more information

## Datasets Shape

The supplied datasets come in different shapes, depending on several configuration parameters. _N_ represents the number
of samples in the dataset:

| user\_num | lookback | mode          | mfcc\_n | Input shape    | Label shape |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| U         | 0        | "mfcc"        | M       | (_N_, M)       | (_N_, U)    |
| U         | L        | "mfcc"        | M       | (_N_, L, M)    | (_N_, U)    |
| U         | 0        | "spectrogram" | n.a.    | (_N_, 1025)    | (_N_, U)    |
| U         | L        | "spectrogram" | n.a.    | (_N_, L, 1025) | (_N_, U)    |

# Example Usage

```python
# Create a supplier class with the configuration dictionary.
sup = MedbaSupplier({"user_num": 15, "verbose": 2})

# Load the datasets internally.
sup.load_datasets()

# Fetch the identification datasets. The adversarial dataset is not needed for identification.
train, valid, test, _ = sup.fetch_and_split_identification()

# Fetch the verification datasets for user with id 42.
train, valid, test, adver = sup.fetch_and_split_verification(42)

# Fetch the authentication datasets.
train, valid, test, adver = sup.fetch_and_split_authentication()
```

# Adding a New Supplier

To include a new dataset extend the Supplier base class by following the steps below. Follow the form put in place by
already included dataset supplier classes:

1. Define the new children class that inherits from the `Supplier` base class.
2. Implement the `load_datasets` method to load the datasets according to the given configuration.
3. Initialize class-specific attributes in the `__init__` method.
4. Implement the `_check_if_downloaded` method to check if the dataset is downloaded, provide guidance on doing so, and
   extract downloaded files.

# Adding a New Threat Model

As definitions of threat models vary, so do the implementation requirements. Following the session takeover attack
mould, adding a new threat model should consist of two steps:

1. Implement a new method in the `Supplier` base class that constructs the data according to the threat model
   definition.
2. Implement a new evaluation function in the `evaluator.py` file to scrutinise against the given threat model.
