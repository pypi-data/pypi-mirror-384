"""Computation Graph Building.

This module allows to build an abstract computation graph using TensorFlow-like
computation primitives and concepts. These primitives and concepts are also similar
to NumPy primitives, albeit with minor naming differences.

This module provides:

1. Basic node types for constants and placeholders
2. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
3. Comparison operations (equal, not_equal, less, less_equal, greater, greater_equal)
4. Logical operations (and, or, xor, not)
5. Mathematical operations (exp, power, log)
6. Shape manipulation operations (expand_dims, squeeze)
7. Reduction operations (sum, mean)
8. Built-in debug operations (tracepoint, breakpoint)
9. Support for infix and unary operators (e.g., `a + b`, `~a`)

The nodes form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents computations
to be performed. Each node implements a specific operation and stores its
inputs as attributes. The graph can then be evaluated by traversing the nodes
and performing their operations using NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.

We anticipate using NumPy/TensorFlow to perform computation based on matrices
of diverse shapes ("tensors"), therefore, we have included operations for shape
manipulation including expanding the dimensions and projecting over the axes. For
example, expand_dims allows to add new axes of size 1 to a tensor's shape, while
project_using_sum allows to compute the sum of tensor elements along specified
axes, thus projecting the tensor onto a lower-dimensional space.

To allow for uniform manipulation, we define the following operation groups:

1. BinaryOp: Operations that take two graph nodes as input
2. UnaryOp: Operations that take one graph node as input
3. AxisOp: Operations that take a graph node and an axis specification as input
and either expand to a higher-dimensional space or reduce to a lower-dimensional
space by projecting over one or more axes using a specific reduction operation.

Here's an example of what you can do with this module:

    >>> from civic_digital_twins.dt_model.engine.frontend import graph
    >>>
    >>> a = graph.placeholder("a", 1.0)
    >>> b = graph.constant(2.0)
    >>> c = a + b
    >>> d = c * c + 1
    >>>
    >>> # Expand to a higher-dimensional space
    >>> e = graph.expand_dims(d, axis=(1,2))
    >>>
    >>> # Project to a lower-dimensional space by summing over axis 0
    >>> f = graph.project_using_sum(e, axis=0)

Like TensorFlow, we support placeholders. That is, variables with a given
name that can be filled in at execution time with concrete values. We also
support constants, which must be bool, float, or int scalars.

Because our goal is to *capture* the arguments provided to function invocations
for later evaluation, we are using classes instead of functions. (We could
alternatively have used closures, but it would have been more clumsy.) To keep
the invoked entities names as close as possible to TensorFlow, we named the
classes using snake_case rather than CamelCase. This is a pragmatic and conscious
choice: violating PEP8 to produce code that reads like TensorFlow.

The main type in this module is the `Node`, representing a node in the
computation graph. Each operation (e.g., `add`) is a subclass of the `Node`
capturing the arguments it has been provided on construction.

Design Decisions
----------------

1. Class-based vs Function-based:
   - Classes capture operation arguments naturally
   - Enable visitor pattern for transformations
   - Allow future addition of operation-specific attributes

2. Snake Case Operation Names:
   - Match NumPy/TensorFlow conventions
   - Improve readability in mathematical context

3. Node Identity:
   - Nodes are identified by their instance identity
   - Enables graph traversal and transformation

Node Identity and Equality
--------------------------

Nodes in this module override Python's standard equality operators (`==`, `!=`, etc.)
to create new graph operations rather than test for object equality.

For example:
    x == y   # Creates a graph.equal operation node
    x < y    # Creates a graph.less operation node

When you need to check if two nodes are the same object (identity comparison),
use Python's `is` operator instead:

    x is y   # Tests if x and y are the same object

This behavior impacts code that needs to find nodes in collections like lists:

    # Won't work as expected:
    nodes.index(my_node)  # Uses `==` internally

    # Correct approach:
    next(i for i, n in enumerate(nodes) if n is my_node)

    Design Notes
    ------------

    1. Identity Semantics:
        - Nodes use identity-based hashing and equality
        - This allows graph traversal algorithms to work correctly
        - Enables use of nodes as dictionary and sets keys

    2. Debug Support:
        - Nodes carry flags for debugging (trace/break)
        - Names for better error reporting
        - Extensible flag system for future debug features
