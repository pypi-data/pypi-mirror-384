"""Provide functions to linearize computation graphs into execution plans.

This module performs topological sorting of graph nodes, ensuring dependencies
are evaluated before the nodes that depend on them.

While we could directly rely on the node's creation ID to perform sorting on
the graph, relying on topological sorting makes the code slightly more robust
because it allows us to detect loops at sorting time.

The linearization process:
1. Starts from output nodes and traverses the graph
2. Ensures all dependencies are scheduled before their dependents
3. Handles common graph structures (conditionals, etc.)

Note that output nodes are also called root nodes because they are seen
as the roots of evaluation trees, while the DAG is a forest of trees.

This is useful for:
- Creating efficient execution plans for evaluators
- Visualizing the computation flow in order
- Debugging models by inspecting operations in a logical sequence

Note on Node Identity
---------------------
Because nodes override equality operators to build computation graphs,
finding nodes within the execution plan must use object identity (`is`),
not equality comparison (`==`).

def forest(*roots: graph.Node) -> list[graph.Node]:
    """
    Linearize a computation forest (multiple output nodes) into an execution plan.

    The nodes passed to this function are called "roots" because (1) they
    represent the nodes you'd like to evaluate and (2) these nodes are
    typically the final results of the computation, which should not depend
    on any other nodes. We start linearization from such root nodes and
    work backwards to schedule all dependencies in order. That said, it's
    possible to apply this algorithm to any node within your graph. The
    result would be the linear scheduling from such node's point of view.

    Args:
        *roots: the nodes to start the linearization process from. Use the
            unpacking operator `*` to pass a list of nodes.

    Returns
    -------
        Topologically sorted list of nodes forming an execution plan

    Raises
    ------
        ValueError: If a cycle is detected in the graph
        TypeError: If an unknown node type is encountered

    Examples
    --------
        >>> # Single output
        >>> plan = linearize.forest(output_node)
        >>>
        >>> # Multiple outputs
        >>> plan = linearize.forest(output1, output2, output3)
        >>>
        >>> # List of outputs
        >>> plan = linearize.forest(*output_list)

    Note on equality
    ----------------

    Because nodes override their equality operators to build computation
    graphs, finding nodes within the execution plan must use object identity, as
    documented more extensively in the `graph` and in this module's docstring.
