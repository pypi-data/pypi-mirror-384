Hello Office of the Prosecutor, 


i write you in the context of communications and claims under art.15 of 
the Rome Statute. i want to inform the prosecutor that the king of the 
netherlands and his government are commiting 3 of the 5 crimes defined 
in the Rome Statute. 

The dutch government has introduced three new forced care laws, the Wfz 
(wet forensische zorg) for criminals, the WvGGZ (Wet verplichte GGZ) for 
the disturbed and addicted and the Wzd (Wet zorg en dwang) for the 
handicapped.

Both the chamber suggesting these laws to the king and the king himself 
have been informed about the fact the the substances administered under 
these laws are proven to be poison.
 
There is proof the medication used in forced treatements in the 
netherlands are poison, see copies of the ECHA <`European Chemical Agency`>
website for:

(1) ``haldol``
(2) ``clozapine``
(3) ``zyprexa``
(4) ``abilify``

With the mass scale torture with poison the king of the netherlands and 
his chamber:

(1) kills
(2) does grave bodily and mental harm
(3) makes impotent

on the following victim groups here in the Netherlands:

(1) verslaafden (addicts)
(2) bejaarden (elderly)
(3) ggz patienten (psychiatric patients)
(4) criminelen (criminials)
(5) gehandicapten (handicapped)

Since the members of the chamber and the king were aware that these
medicine are poison at the time they voted for this law and the day the Wfz
law took effect (1-1-2019), i ask the prosecutor to prosecute the king for
making the commiting of the above mentioned crimes (killing, torture and
impotent making) possible.
