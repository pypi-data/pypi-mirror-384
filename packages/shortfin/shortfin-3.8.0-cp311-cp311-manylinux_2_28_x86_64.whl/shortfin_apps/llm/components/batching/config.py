"""
Provides types and classes to control batching behavior.
The idea is to encode all the knobs and control points into
a dataclass, and pass that to an opaque factory. To the caller
the internal API is completely opaque.
This prevents leakage of internal types and execution, and, consequently,
coupling of any kind, allowing us to modify and optimize as we want without
touching other code.
