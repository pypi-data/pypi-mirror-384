# Reanalysis ERA5

For updated documentation please go [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation).

ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.

ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals.

**There is a script scheduled to run periodically to download the latest month's data.**

## Downloaded Dataset Variables

These are the variables currently available for download. If a new variable is required, it MUST be added to the `ERA5_config.json` file, and then to the code or crontab downloading the files.

These variables represent different atmospheric, ocean-wave, and land-surface quantities that are provided by the ERA5 dataset. Each variable has a corresponding path that specifies where the data is located within the dataset.

## Scripts used to download data

To download the Reanalysis ERA5 single levels dataset, you can use the following scripts:

1. Main Python script: `copernicus_downloader.py`.

```python
from bluemath_tk.downloaders.copernicus.copernicus_downloader import CopernicusDownloader

copernicus_downloader = CopernicusDownloader(
    product="ERA5",
    base_path_to_download="/path/to/Copernicus/",  # Will be created if not available
    token=None,
    check=True,
)
result = copernicus_downloader.download_data_era5(
    variables=["swh"],
    years=["2020"],
    months=["01", "03"],
)
print(result)
```

2. Python script: `ERA5_download.py`.

3. Bash scripts: `bash_ERA5_download.sh and qsub_ERA5_download.sh` in [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/geoocean/datahub/datahub-scripts/-/tree/main/ERA5/launchers?ref_type=heads).

This script creates and submits jobs to download several datasets simultaneously.

```Exception: Requests using the API temporally limited to 20 to restrict the activity of abusive users. Please visit copernicus-support.ecmwf.int for further information.```

For more information on how to use the scripts and download the Reanalysis ERA5 single levels dataset, please refer to the [documentation](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview).

## Issues with data download limits

To ensure the protection of CDS resources, limits have been set for data downloads. You can find more information about these limits [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/live/limits).

To adhere to these limits, we have developed the `download_ERA5.sh` script and configured the cron of the user responsible for data downloads to initiate periodic downloads. To prevent user-specific limits, we have set up cron to periodically update the credentials of the user performing the data downloads.
