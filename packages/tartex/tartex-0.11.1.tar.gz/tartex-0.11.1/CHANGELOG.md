# Changelog

## 0.11.1 [2025-10-17]

### Fixed

- Strip unnecessary white-spaces from LaTeX warning messages when joining multiple lines.
- Do not treat missing `latexmk` as latexmk error; the latter typically refers to LaTeX errors when compiling project using latexmk.

## 0.11.0 [2025-10-08]

### Added

- Use different exit codes based on source of failure: latexmk compilation, git checkout, adding to tarball, or generic otherwise.
- Filter out common LaTeX errors (and warning, when using `-v`) for output messages when latexmk fails to compile.
- Save full log from latexmk in case compilation fails to a file in command directory.

### Fixed

- Do not send empty lists computed for `--bib` or `--add` options to `TarBaller`.
- Do not try to build exclusion list for `--excl` if the option is not used.
- Fix output message during `--check(-only)` when reference tarball fails to compile; this may not exclusively be due to missing input files.
- Log TeX warnings only when using verbose output (`-v...`).

## [0.10.4] 2025-09-30

### Fixed

- Ensure object is not `None` before using as `Path` param; fixes tar generation being aborted when `-b` option is used for non-bibtex projects.

## [0.10.3] 2025-09-28

### Fixed

- Use 7-character short shasum ref for cache filename for consistency with default git short refs.
- Reduce default volume of log messages when LaTeXmk compilation fails.

## [0.10.2] 2025-09-21

### Fixed

- When using `--git-rev`, do not attempt to checkout revision if repository is unclean; raise error early.
- Restore original git tree when process raises error while working in repo checked out at specified revision.
- Better logs when main input file is not found.

## [0.10.1] 2025-09-20

### Fixed

- Fix extra dot in extension when using new name to resolve tar name conflict.

## [0.10.0] 2025-09-20

### Added

- Generate and use cache file to track changes to input dependencies, based on content hashes.
- Do not use or update cache when using in-project '.fls' file as input or when forcing a recompile (`-F`).
- Use `rich` as logging handler for better style and formatting of log messages.

### Fixed

- Do not raise error on miss supplementary files when using `-F`/`--force-recompile` as they will be regenerated anyway.
- Fix duplicate info-log messages when adding bib file (and related styles).
- Clearer, terser logs all around.

## [0.9.0] 2025-09-14

### Added

- Add `--check` option to check if all files needed for recompiling project will be included in tarball.
- Add `--only-check` option to print a detailed report on missing, necessary, and unnecessary files to be included, without actually generating the tar file.
- Make file pattern matching for `--add` or `--excl` options recurse into sub-directories starting at source directory.

### Fixed

- Do not exclude main tex file even if matched by `--excl` pattern.
- Improved shell completions for `--git-ref`.
- Avoid adding duplicate files when using `--git-rev`.
- Suppress unnecessary conflict dialog in `--list` mode.
- Fix incorrect setting of working dir.
- Better help messages, logging, and documentation all around.
