# RTMDet â€“ PyTorch Implementation

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work--in--progress-yellow)

This repository is a **PyTorch port of RTMDet**, originally implemented in [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

The goal is to reimplement the network in pure PyTorch while making it possible to **load pretrained weights** from the original models.
