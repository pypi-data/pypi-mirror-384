    Process a neighboring cell in a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) grid for pathfinding.

    This function calculates the cost of moving to a neighboring cell and updates the
    cost and previous cell information if the calculated cost is lower than the current

    cost is updated.

        - next_row (int): Row index of the neighboring cell.
        - next_col (int): Column index of the neighboring cell.

    Compute least-cost paths for breach points in parallel within a given search radius.

    This function computes the least-cost paths for breach points in parallel within a specified search radius. It uses

    window is exhausted. Once a breach point is found, it reconstructs the least-cost path from the final breach point
