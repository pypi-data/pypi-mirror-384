# The setuptools process adds a bunch of files by default into the sdist. But
# we need to extend it a bit, and also make sure things that are not suitable
# for distribution are not included.

# Specific files to add to the release
include tox.ini
include code/ibmmq/ibmmqc.h
include CHANGELOG.md

# And complete directories
graft   code/examples
graft   code/tests
graft   docs

# NOT going to include ./tools. If you need to work with
# those, then the git clone will include them.
