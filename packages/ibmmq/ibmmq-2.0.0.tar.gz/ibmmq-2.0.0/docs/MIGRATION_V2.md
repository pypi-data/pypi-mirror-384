To migrate from PyMQI V1 to the IBMMQ V2 package:

* Make sure your versions of MQ and Python meet the minimum levels given in the [README](README.md)
* Use pip with the new package name: `pip install ibmmq`
* Change applications to import the new name. You can use `import ibmmq as pymqi`to avoid changing the rest of the
  application code.
* Check application code for use of previously-deprecated definitions. The most likely misuse is of the `MQCHT_`
  variables, which are in CMQXC, not CMQC.

See the `V2.0.0b1` entry at the bottom of the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more details on what has been removed and
added.

PyMQI V1 had its own backwards-compatibility option for some of its original classes and method names. Those old names
did not conform to the now-preferred `snake_case` style. For example, there's `md = MD` and
`connectWithOptions = connect_with_options`. Those trivial aliases have been kept for the V2 library, but should not be
used for future development.
