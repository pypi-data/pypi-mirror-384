ibmmq - Python Classes for IBM MQ

These classes wrap the lower level C MQI calls. They present an OO
interface originally inspired by the MQI C++ classes.

Classes are also provided for easy use of the MQI structure parameters
(MQMD, MQGMO etc.) from Python. These allow Python scripts to set/get
structure members by attribute, dictionary etc.

External classes corresponding to MQI structures include:

    * MD              - Main MQI structures
    * CNO, CSP
    * BNO, SCO, CD
    * OD,  SD
    * GMO, PMO
    * SRO, STS

    * CBD, CTLO, CBC - Related to callbacks

    * CMHO, DMHO       - Message Properties
    * IMPO, SMPO, DMPO
    * PD

    * RFH2             - Application structures
    * DLH
    * TM, TMC2
    * IIH, CIH         - IMS, CICS headers

    * CFH              - PCF elements
    * CFGR
    * CFIL, CFIL64
    * CFIN, CFIN64
    * CFSF, CFBF, CFIF
    * CFSL, CFST
    * CFBS

Classes for MQ objects include
    * QueueManager
    * Queue
    * Topic
    * Subscription
    * MessageHandle

    * PCFExecute - Programmable Command Format operations

    * MQMIError - MQI specific error
    * PYIFError - Python library error

The following MQI operations are supported:

    * MQCONN, MQDISC (QueueManager.connect()/QueueManager.disconnect())
    * MQCONNX (QueueManager.connectWithOptions())
    * MQOPEN/MQCLOSE (Queue.open(), Queue.close(), Topic.open(), Topic.close())
    * MQPUT/MQPUT1/MQGET (Queue.put(), QueueManager.put1(), Queue.get(), Topic.pub())
    * MQSTAT (QueueManager.stat())
    * MQCMIT/MQBACK (QueueManager.commit()/QueueManager.backout())
    * MQBEGIN (QueueManager.begin())
    * MQINQ (QueueManager.inquire(), Queue.inquire())
    * MQSET (Queue.set())
    * MQSUB/MQSUBRQ (Subscription.sub(), Subscription.subrq())
    * MQCRTMH/MQDLTMH (MessageHandle(), MessageHandle.dlt())
    * MQSETMP/MQINQMP/MQDLTMP (MessageHandle.properties.set(), MessageHandle.properties.inq(), MessageHandle.properties.dlt())

To use this package, connect to the Queue Manager (using QueueManager.connect()), then open a queue (using
Queue.open()). You may then put or get messages on the queue (using Queue.put(), Queue.get()), as required.

Where possible, this package assumes the MQI defaults for all parameters. It can also defer a queue open until the put/get call.

The library maps all MQI warning & error status to the MQMIError exception. Errors detected by the package itself raise
the PYIFError exception. Both these exceptions are subclasses of the Error class.

MQI constants are defined in the CMQC and CMQXC modules; PCF constants are defined in CMQCFC.

PCF commands and inquiries are executed by calling a MQCMD_* method on an instance of a PCFExecute object.

The package is thread safe. Objects have the same thread scope as their MQI counterparts.
