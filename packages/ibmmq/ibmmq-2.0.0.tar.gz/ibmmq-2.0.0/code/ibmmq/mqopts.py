# MQI Python<->C Structure mapping. MQI uses lots of parameter passing
# structures in its API. These classes are used to set/get the
# parameters in the style of Python dictionaries & keywords. Pack &
# unpack calls are used to convert between python class attributes and
# 'C' structures, suitable for passing in/out of C functions.
#
# The MQOpts class defines common operations for structure definition,
# default values setting, member set/get and translation to & from 'C'
# structures. Specializations construct MQOpts with a list specifying
# structure member names, their default values, and pack/unpack
# formats. MQOpts uses this list to setup class attributes
# corresponding to the structure names, set up attribute defaults, and
# builds a format string usable by the struct package to translate to
# 'C' structures.

class MQOpts:
    """ Base class for packing/unpacking MQI Option structures. It is
    constructed with a list defining the member/attribute name,
    default value (from the CMQC module) and the member pack format
    (see the struct module for the formats). The list format is:

      [['Member0', CMQC.DEFAULT_VAL0, 'fmt1']
       ['Member1', CMQC.DEFAULT_VAL1, 'fmt2']
         ...
      ]

    MQOpts defines common methods to allow structure members to be
    set/get as attributes (foo.Member0 = 42), set/get as dictionary
    items (foo['Member0'] = 42) or set as keywords (foo.set(Member0 =
    42, Member1 = 'flipperhat'). The ctor can be passed an optional
    keyword list to initialize the structure members to non-default
    values. The get method returns all attributes as a dictionary.

    The pack() method packs all members into a 'C' structure according
    to the format specifiers passed to the ctor. The packing order is
    as specified in the list passed to the ctor. Pack returns a string
    buffer, which can be passed directly to the MQI 'C' calls.

    For packing, strings are truncated or padded with null bytes as appropriate to
    make them fit the given field length. There is no warning of overlong strings
    such as trying to use a 64-char queue name. For unpacking, the resulting bytes object
    always has exactly the specified number of bytes.

    The unpack() method does the opposite of pack. It unpacks a
    buffer into an MQOpts instance.

    Applications are not expected to use MQOpts directly. Instead,
    MQOpts is sub-classed as particular MQI structures.
