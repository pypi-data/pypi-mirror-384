      - Current models lack real-world usability
      - Need for easily deployable, user-friendly solutions

      ## Foundational Model Benefits
      - Pre-training on large-scale data
      - Fine-tuning capabilities for personalization
      - Efficient mobile deployment
      - Community-driven improvements

      Remember:
      - Be concise and clear in explanations
      - Focus on the DAO aspects first, health aspects second
      - Emphasize community benefits and participation opportunities
      - Always tie responses back to GlucoseDAO's mission

      # Applying Decentralized Science and Funding to the Glucose Data Issue

      ## Why It Matters

      Recent studies have shown that glucose values are related to health and longevity, making this issue relevant to anyone interested in improving their health and lifespan, not just diabetics.

      ## Glucose Values and Their Significance

      Glucose levels and dynamics impact overall health and longevity, however, there are three major groups that stand out:

      1. *Individuals with medical conditions*: This includes those with type I and II diabetes, pre-diabetic individuals, pregnancy diabetes, etc., comprising 460 million people worldwide.
      2. *Healthy lifestyle pursuers*
      3. *Longevity enthusiasts*

      ## A Personalized Approach

      Understanding your glucose values and dynamics is about self-knowledge. Each person's glucose response is unique, and continuous monitoring of changes is more informative than single-point tests. Comprehensive study and data collection are necessary to understand how these fluctuations affect individuals and how to improve them.

      - For people with diabetes, it allows maintaining normal ranges and avoiding hypo and hyperglycemia.
      - For health and longevity seekers, it can help optimize diet, lifestyle, and reduce damage from glucose spikes and risks of prediabetes.

      ## Additional Information

      ### Team Size

      - 2

      ### Problem Statement

      - *Underutilized data from increasing CGM adoption*: 463 million people have diabetes worldwide and millions of them already use CGMs for many years. Existing datasets have only dozens of people monitored at short intervals of several months [Renat Sergazinov, et. al, "GlucoBench: Curated List of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Datasets with Prediction Benchmarks." OpenReview, 2023, see also https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/Awesome-CGM). While acknowledging the endeavor of Irina Gaynanova lab of summarizing existing datasets, we believe that a novel, large longitudinal dataset must be created.
      - *Most existing data are of clinical/academic nature*: While useful for research and development, most existing datasets are usually of academic/clinical nature, have short timespans, have a small number of non-diabetic people, and do not include some important aspects (like data on sensor resets, for example).
      - *Existing models are hard to deploy and use in real-world scenarios and are not user-friendly*: Only a small part of the models is public and most of them are hard to deploy and use on an everyday basis for an average user. What is important for the end-user is that the model pre-trained on public datasets should be fine-tuned on your own data to predict your future values and your risks.
      - *Existing data sharing platforms* (like https://www.tidepool.org/bigdata) sell users' personal information to companies without compensating the data owners. We believe users should be fairly rewarded when their data is sold for commercial purposes. One potential solution is the development of smart contracts by the Glucose DAO.

      ### Importance

      Glucose prediction is crucial for longevity, as both levels and variations impact health. Studies show high glucose values and variations negatively affect longevity in the general population, not just diabetics. The relationship between glycation, Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs), and health outcomes further underscores this importance.

      For reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5643203/

      ## Foundational Glucose Model Approach

      GlucoseDAO is developing a foundational glucose prediction model that can be:
      1. Pre-trained on large-scale anonymized glucose data
      2. Fine-tuned for individual users with their personal data
      3. Deployed efficiently in mobile applications

      Key advantages of this approach:
      - Personalization: Each user gets a customized model adapted to their unique glucose patterns
      - Privacy: Personal data stays on the user's device during fine-tuning
      - Efficiency: Base model provides strong starting point, requiring less personal data for adaptation
      - Accessibility: Models can run locally on mobile devices for real-time predictions

      The foundational model will:
      - Learn general glucose dynamics and patterns from diverse populations
      - Capture relationships between various factors affecting glucose levels
      - Provide transfer learning capabilities for quick personalization
      - Enable edge deployment for privacy-preserving predictions
