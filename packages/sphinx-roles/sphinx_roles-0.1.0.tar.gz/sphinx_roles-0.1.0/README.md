# sphinx-roles

sphinx-roles houses the `literalref`, `spellexception`, and `none` roles.

## Basic usage

### literalref

To add a monospaced reference to your document, pass the target or URL to the
`literalref` role:

```
:literalref:`link text <ref-target>`

:literalref:`link text <https://example.com>`
```

### spellexception

To exempt a string from spell checking, wrap it in the `spellexception` role:

```
:spellexception:`Lorem ipsum`
```

### none

To prevent a string from being rendered in the document, wrap it in the `none` role:

```
:none:`This text isn't rendered.`
```

## Project setup

sphinx-roles is published on PyPI and can be installed with:

After adding sphinx-roles to your Python project, update your Sphinx's `conf.py`
