# Asserting Objects

The module provides two ways of asserting objects.

## Using the `assert_object` Function

The most basic way to assert an object is by using the following function:

```python
def assert_object(
    expectation: Any,
    object_: Any,
    *,
    asserter_factory: type[AsserterFactoryProtocol] = BuiltInAsserterFactory,
) -> None: ...
```

In basic usage, it accepts an expectation and an object to be asserted. For more complicated use cases, it also accepts a custom asserter factory â€” a class used to create asserters that ensure a given type of expectation is fulfilled by the provided object.

The function doesn't return anything but raises an `AssertionError` with an error description as a message when the object does not fulfill the expectation.

For more information on asserters and factories, see [Asserters](40.asserters.md).

## Using the `Expectation` Class

The module also provides an `Expectation` class, which overrides the `__eq__` magic method to perform object assertion.

It is initialized with the expectation and optionally an asserter factory to be used. Then it can be compared to an object that should fulfill the expectation.

The comparison will return `True` if the object fulfills the expectation and `False` otherwise.

```python
assert Expectation(expectation) == object_
assert Expectation(expectation) != object_
```

This approach is mostly useful in combination with `assert_context`. The following code checks that the return value of `foo()` fulfills the `expectation`:

```python
with assert_context(result=Expectation(expectation)) as context:
    context.set(foo())
```
