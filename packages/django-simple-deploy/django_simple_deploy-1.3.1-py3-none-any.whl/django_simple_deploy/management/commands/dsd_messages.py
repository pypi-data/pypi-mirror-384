"""A collection of messages used in deploy.py."""

# Storing messages here makes for a much shorter deploy.py file, and
#   makes it easier to see how the messages actually look on screen. The
#   disadvantage is that it's harder to track what messages are being
#   displayed when doing development work.
# When you add a message here, make sure the stdout.write() call has a comment
#   that clearly summarizes what the message says.
#
# Line length conventions
# - Try to keep lines at the 79-char PEP 8 limit, but the project is not
#   overly strict about it at this point.
#
# - DynamicMessages
#   - It can be helpful to make a second vertical line at 86 characters
#     (78 characters + two indentation levels) to judge the line lengths
#     for dynamic messages.

The output of `git status` indicates that you have uncommitted changes.

We highly recommend you commit all changes before running the deploy command,

you wish to deploy to a different platform.

Please commit all changes and then run the deploy command again. If you really
wish to continue without committing current changes, you can use
the --ignore-unclean-git flag.
