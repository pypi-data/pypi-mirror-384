Thread number set to 24
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
A spectral library will be generated
Deep learning will be used to generate a new in silico spectral library from peptides provided
Library-free search enabled
Min fragment m/z set to 50
Max fragment m/z set to 2000
N-terminal methionine excision enabled
Min peptide length set to 6
Max peptide length set to 40
Min precursor m/z set to 400
Max precursor m/z set to 1000
Min precursor charge set to 1
Max precursor charge set to 4
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Maximum number of missed cleavages set to 1
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:1 with mass delta 42.0106 at *n will be considered as variable
Neural networks will be used for peak selection
Peptidoform scoring enabled
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
Heuristic protein grouping will be used, to reduce the number of protein groups obtained; this mode is recommended for benchmarking protein ID numbers, GO/pathway and system-scale analyses
The spectral library (if generated) will retain the original spectra but will include empirically-aligned RTs
Implicit protein grouping: protein names; this determines which peptides are considered 'proteotypic' and thus affects protein FDR calculation
DIA-NN will optimise the mass accuracy automatically using the first run in the experiment. This is useful primarily for quick initial analyses, when it is not yet known which mass accuracy setting works best for a particular acquisition scheme.
Exclusion of fragments shared between heavy and light peptides from quantification is not supported in FASTA digest mode - disabled; to enable, generate an in silico predicted spectral library and analyse with this library
WARNING: it is strongly recommended to first generate an in silico-predicted library in a separate pipeline step and then use it to process the raw data, now without activating FASTA digest
The following variable modifications will be scored: UniMod:35 UniMod:1 
WARNING: double-pass mode is incompatible with PTM scoring, turned off
