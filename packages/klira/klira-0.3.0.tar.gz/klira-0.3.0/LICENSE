   "Commercial Use" means any use of the Software (i) in connection with any business activity, 
   (ii) in a production environment serving end users, (iii) that generates revenue directly 
   or indirectly, (iv) by or for any commercial entity, (v) that provides competitive 
   advantage in any commercial context, or (vi) in any organizational context where the

   "Licensor" refers to Klira AI Technologies and its authorized representatives.
   "API Key" means the unique authentication token issued by Klira AI for accessing the Software 
   and associated services.

   This license is granted only upon successful registration and activation using a valid

     technical protection measures, or authentication mechanisms
