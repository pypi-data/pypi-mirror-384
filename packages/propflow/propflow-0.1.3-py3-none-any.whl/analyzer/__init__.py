"""PropFlow analysis helpers for recording and interpreting engine runs.

The package exposes:

* `EngineSnapshotRecorder` for capturing per-iteration message traffic.
* `SnapshotAnalyzer` and `AnalysisReport` for deriving graph metrics, influence
  scores, and connected-component insights from recorded snapshots.

See `src/analyzer/README.md` and `examples/` for end-to-end usage guidance.
