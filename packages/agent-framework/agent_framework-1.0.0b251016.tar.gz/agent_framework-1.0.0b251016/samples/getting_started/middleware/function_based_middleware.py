Function-based Middleware Example

This sample demonstrates how to implement middleware using simple async functions instead of classes.
The example includes:

- Security middleware that validates agent requests for sensitive information
- Logging middleware that tracks function execution timing and parameters
- Performance monitoring to measure execution duration

Function-based middleware is ideal for simple, stateless operations and provides a more
lightweight approach compared to class-based middleware. Both agent and function middleware
can be implemented as async functions that accept context and next parameters.
