"""
Class-based Middleware Example

This sample demonstrates how to implement middleware using class-based approach by inheriting
from AgentMiddleware and FunctionMiddleware base classes. The example includes:

- SecurityAgentMiddleware: Checks for security violations in user queries and blocks requests
  containing sensitive information like passwords or secrets
- LoggingFunctionMiddleware: Logs function execution details including timing and parameters

This approach is useful when you need stateful middleware or complex logic that benefits
from object-oriented design patterns.
