"""
Shared State Function-based Middleware Example

This sample demonstrates how to implement function-based middleware within a class to share state.
The example includes:

- A MiddlewareContainer class with two simple function middleware methods
- First middleware: Counts function calls and stores the count in shared state
- Second middleware: Uses the shared count to add call numbers to function results

This approach shows how middleware can work together by sharing state within the same class instance.
