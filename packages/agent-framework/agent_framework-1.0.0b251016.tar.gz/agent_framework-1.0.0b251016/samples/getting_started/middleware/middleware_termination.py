Middleware Termination Example

This sample demonstrates how middleware can terminate execution using the `context.terminate` flag.
The example includes:

- PreTerminationMiddleware: Terminates execution before calling next() to prevent agent processing
- PostTerminationMiddleware: Allows processing to complete but terminates further execution

This is useful for implementing security checks, rate limiting, or early exit conditions.
