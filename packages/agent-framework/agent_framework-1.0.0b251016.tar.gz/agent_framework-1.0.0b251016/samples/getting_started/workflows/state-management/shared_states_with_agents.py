"""
Sample: Shared state with agents and conditional routing.

Store an email once by id, classify it with a detector agent, then either draft a reply with an assistant
agent or finish with a spam notice. Stream events as the workflow runs.

Purpose:
Show how to:
- Use shared state to decouple large payloads from messages and pass around lightweight references.
- Enforce structured agent outputs with Pydantic models via response_format for robust parsing.
- Route using conditional edges based on a typed intermediate DetectionResult.
- Compose agent backed executors with function style executors and yield the final output when the workflow completes.

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient with required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, executors, conditional edges, and streaming runs.
