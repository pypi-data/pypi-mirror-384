"""
Sample: Foundational sequential workflow with streaming using function-style executors.

Two lightweight steps run in order. The first converts text to uppercase.
The second reverses the text and yields the workflow output. Events are printed as they arrive from run_stream.

Purpose:
Show how to declare executors with the @executor decorator, connect them with WorkflowBuilder,
pass intermediate values using ctx.send_message, and yield final output using ctx.yield_output().
Demonstrate how streaming exposes ExecutorInvokedEvent and ExecutorCompletedEvent for observability.

Prerequisites:
- No external services required.
