"""
Sample: Sequential workflow with streaming.

Two custom executors run in sequence. The first converts text to uppercase,
the second reverses the text and completes the workflow. The run_stream loop prints events as they occur.

Purpose:
Show how to define explicit Executor classes with @handler methods, wire them in order with
WorkflowBuilder, and consume streaming events. Demonstrate typed WorkflowContext[T_Out, T_W_Out] for outputs,
ctx.send_message to pass intermediate values, and ctx.yield_output to provide workflow outputs.

Prerequisites:
- No external services required.
