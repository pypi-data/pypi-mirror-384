Sample: Conditional routing with structured outputs

What this sample is:
- A minimal decision workflow that classifies an inbound email as spam or not spam, then routes to the
appropriate handler.

Purpose:
- Show how to attach boolean edge conditions that inspect an AgentExecutorResponse.
- Demonstrate using Pydantic models as response_format so the agent returns JSON we can validate and parse.
- Illustrate how to transform one agent's structured result into a new AgentExecutorRequest for a downstream agent.

Prerequisites:
- You understand the basics of WorkflowBuilder, executors, and events in this framework.
- You know the concept of edge conditions and how they gate routes using a predicate function.
- Azure OpenAI access is configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient. You should be logged in with Azure CLI (AzureCliCredential)
and have the Azure OpenAI environment variables set as documented in the getting started chat client README.
- The sample email resource file exists at workflow/resources/email.txt.

High level flow:
1) spam_detection_agent reads an email and returns DetectionResult.
2) If not spam, we transform the detection output into a user message for email_assistant_agent, then finish by
yielding the drafted reply as workflow output.
3) If spam, we short circuit to a spam handler that yields a spam notice as workflow output.

Output:
- The final workflow output is printed to stdout, either with a drafted reply or a spam notice.

Notes:
- Conditions read the agent response text and validate it into DetectionResult for robust routing.
- Executors are small and single purpose to keep control flow easy to follow.
- The workflow completes when it becomes idle, not via explicit completion events.
