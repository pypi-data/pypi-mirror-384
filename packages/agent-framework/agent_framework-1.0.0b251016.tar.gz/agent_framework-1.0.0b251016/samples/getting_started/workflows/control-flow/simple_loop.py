"""
Sample: Simple Loop (with an Agent Judge)

What it does:
- Guesser performs a binary search; judge is an agent that returns ABOVE/BELOW/MATCHED.
- Demonstrates feedback loops in workflows with agent steps.
- The workflow completes when the correct number is guessed.

Prerequisites:
- Azure AI/ Azure OpenAI for `AzureOpenAIChatClient` agent.
- Authentication via `azure-identity` â€” uses `AzureCliCredential()` (run `az login`).
