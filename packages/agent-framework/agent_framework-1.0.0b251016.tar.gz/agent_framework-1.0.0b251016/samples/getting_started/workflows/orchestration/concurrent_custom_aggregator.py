Sample: Concurrent Orchestration with Custom Aggregator

Build a concurrent workflow with ConcurrentBuilder that fans out one prompt to
multiple domain agents and fans in their responses. Override the default
aggregator with a custom async callback that uses AzureOpenAIChatClient.get_response()
to synthesize a concise, consolidated summary from the experts' outputs.
The workflow completes when all participants become idle.

Demonstrates:
- ConcurrentBuilder().participants([...]).with_custom_aggregator(callback)
- Fan-out to agents and fan-in at an aggregator
- Aggregation implemented via an LLM call (chat_client.get_response)
- Workflow output yielded with the synthesized summary string

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient (az login + required env vars)

    Sample Output:

    ===== Final Consolidated Output =====
    Urban e-bike demand is rising rapidly due to eco-awareness, urban congestion, and high fuel costs,
    with market growth projected at a ~10% CAGR through 2030. Key customer concerns are affordability,
    easy maintenance, convenient charging, compact design, and theft protection. Differentiation opportunities
    include integrating smart features (GPS, app connectivity), offering subscription or leasing options, and
    developing portable, space-saving designs. Partnering with local governments and bike shops can boost visibility.

    Risks include price wars eroding margins, regulatory hurdles, battery quality concerns, and heightened expectations
    for after-sales support. Accurate, substantiated product claims and transparent marketing (with range disclaimers)
    are essential. All e-bikes must comply with local and federal regulations on speed, wattage, safety certification,
    and labeling. Clear warranty, safety instructions (especially regarding batteries), and inclusive, accessible
    marketing are required. For connected features, data privacy policies and user consents are mandatory.

    Effective messaging should target young professionals, students, eco-conscious commuters, and first-time buyers,
    emphasizing affordability, convenience, and sustainability. Slogan suggestion: “Charge Ahead—City Commutes Made
    Affordable.” Legal review in each target market, compliance vetting, and robust customer support policies are
    critical before launch.
