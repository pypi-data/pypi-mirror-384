"""
This sample shows how you can configure observability of an application with zero code changes.
It relies on the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation capabilities, and the observability setup
is done via environment variables.

This sample requires the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to be set.

Run the sample with the following command:
```
uv run --env-file=.env opentelemetry-instrument python advanced_zero_code.py
```

    This function runs an AI service and prints the output.

    Remarks:
        When function calling is outside the open telemetry loop
        each of the call to the model is handled as a seperate span,
        while when the open telemetry is put last, a single span
        is shown, which might include one or more rounds of function calling.

        2 spans with gen_ai.operation.name=chat
            The first has finish_reason "tool_calls"
            The second has finish_reason "stop"
