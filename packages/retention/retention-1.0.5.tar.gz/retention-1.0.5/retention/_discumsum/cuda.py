@torch.library.custom_op("retention::discumsum", mutates_args=())
def discumsum(X : torch.Tensor, log_G : torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    r"""Compute discounted cumulative sum for recurrent processing.

    This function implements the discounted cumulative sum operation from [1]. It is a key
    component in transforming symmetric power retention into a linear-cost RNN, allowing
    efficient processing of long sequences through chunked computation.

    The operation implements the state update equation of the RNN:

    $$Y_t = X_t + \exp(\log G_t) \cdot Y_{t-1}$$

    with initial condition $Y_0 = 0$

    In the context of symmetric power retention:

    - $X_t$ contains expanded state vectors from the current chunk
    - $Y_t$ accumulates state information across chunks
    - $exp(log\ G_t)$ controls how much past information influences the current computation
    - The +1 in the output time dimension allows for proper causality in the RNN

    This formulation enables O(n) complexity instead of O(nÂ²) for long sequences, while
    maintaining the expressivity of power retention through the expanded state representation.

    Args:
        X: Input tensor of shape `(batch_size, time, num_heads, *feature_dims)`.
           The tensor to be accumulated along the time dimension.
        log_G: Log discount factors of shape `(batch_size, time, num_heads)`.
           Natural logarithm of the discount/gating factors.
           These are broadcasted along the feature dimensions.

    Returns:
        Y: Accumulated tensor of shape `(batch_size, time+1, num_heads, *feature_dims)`.
           Note that the output has one more timestep than the input, with zeros at t=0.

    Note:
        - Time dimension must be a multiple of 4
        - Product of feature dimensions must be a multiple of 8
        - The batch and heads dimensions are treated as independent batch dimensions
        - Initial state support is planned but not yet implemented
        - The RNN formulation maintains O(1) memory per layer regardless of sequence length
