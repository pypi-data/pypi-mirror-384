- **Configurable Parsing**: Flexible options for delimiters, quote characters, escape characters, header/footer row(s) handling
- **Memory-Efficient Streaming**: Process large files without loading entire content into memory
- **Security & Validation**: Comprehensive path validation and file permission checks
- **Unicode Support**: Full Unicode character and encoding support
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations with mypy validation
- **Deterministic Newline Handling**: Consistent handling of CRLF, CR, and LF newlines across platforms
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for quick parsing and inspection of DSV files
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear and specific exceptions for various error scenarios
- **Modern API**: Object-oriented API with `Dsv` and `DsvConfig` classes for easy configuration and reuse
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: In-depth API reference and usage examples
- **Exhaustive Testing**: 283 tests with 93% code coverage including property-based testing, edge case testing, and cross-platform compatibility validation

**⚠️ CHANGES in v2025.3.2**
> - **splurge-safe-io** dependency has been updated to v2025.0.6+.
>   - This change improves compatibility and stability with the latest features of the `splurge-safe-io` package.
>   - Code and tests have been updated to align with the new version of the dependency, ensuring continued robust and secure file I/O operations.

**⚠️ CHANGES in v2025.3.1**
> - **skip_empty_lines** option added to `DsvConfig`, `DsvHelper`, and CLI.
>   - This option allows users to skip logical empty lines when parsing DSV files.

**⚠️ CHANGES in v2025.3.0**
> - **Commit-Only Release**: v2025.3.0 is a commit-only release and will not be published to PyPI.
> - The legacy `parse_stream()` helpers were removed in release 2025.3.0.
>   - Use `parse_file_stream()` on `Dsv`/`DsvHelper` for stream-based parsing of files. This standardizes the API naming and clarifies that streaming helpers accept file paths rather than arbitrary iterables.
> - TextFileHelper, SafeTextFileReader, SafeTextFileWriter, and PathValidator, as well as all their associated tests have been removed in this release.
>   - Their functionality has been migrated in favor of the `splurge-safe-io` package, which provides robust and secure file I/O operations.
>   - This change reduces code duplication and improves maintainability by leveraging the functionality of `splurge-safe-io`.
>   - Users should refer to the `splurge-safe-io` documentation for details on its usage and features.
> - **See API-REFERENCE.md for migration guidance and complete reference documentation, with usage examples.**

**⚠️ CHANGES in v2025.2.2**
> - **Deprecated Warning**: The following modules and their associated classes and functions are deprecated and will be removed in a future release (2025.3.0). Users are encouraged to transition to the `splurge-safe-io` package for these functionalities:
>   - `splurge_dsv.safe_text_file_reader`
>   - `splurge_dsv.safe_text_file_writer`
>   - `splurge_dsv.path_validator`
>   - `splurge_dsv.text_file_helper`
> - **New Exception**: Added `SplurgeDsvFileExistsError` to handle file existence errors.
> - **Fixed Exception Mapping**: Many errors were incorrectly mapped to SplurgeDsvEncodingError; this has been corrected to use appropriate exception types. 
>   - Some exceptions were not mapped to any SplurgeDsv* exception; these have also been corrected.
> - **3rd-Party Dependency Additions**: Added `splurge-safe-io (v2025.0.4)`.
>   - `splurge-safe-io` is a new dependency that provides robust and secure file I/O operations, including safe text file reading and writing with deterministic newline handling and path validation.
>   - This change reduces code duplication and improves maintainability by leveraging the functionality of `splurge-safe-io`.
>   - Users should refer to the `splurge-safe-io` documentation for details on its usage and features.
> - **Code Refactoring**: Refactored `SafeTextFileReader`, `SafeTextFileWriter`, and `PathValidator` to utilize `splurge-safe-io` implementations internally, ensuring consistent behavior and reducing maintenance overhead.
> - **This release maintains backward compatibility** for existing users, but users are encouraged to transition to `splurge-safe-io` for future-proofing their codebases.
>   - **_This release is a commit-only release and will not be published to PyPI._**

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES in v2025.2.0**
>
> - **Exception Names Changed**: All exceptions now use `SplurgeDsv*` prefix (e.g., `SplurgeParameterError` → `SplurgeDsvParameterError`)
> - **Resource Manager Removed**: The `ResourceManager` module and all related classes have been completely removed
>
> See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for migration guidance.

## Installation

```bash
pip install splurge-dsv
```

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Parse a CSV file
python -m splurge_dsv data.csv --delimiter ,

# Stream a large file
python -m splurge_dsv large_file.csv --delimiter , --stream --chunk-size 1000
```

### YAML configuration file

You can place CLI-equivalent options in a YAML file and pass it to the CLI
using `--config` (or `-c`). CLI arguments override values found in the
YAML file. Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
delimiter: ","
strip: true
bookend: '"'
encoding: utf-8
skip_header_rows: 1
skip_footer_rows: 0
skip_empty_lines: false
detect_columns: true
chunk_size: 500
max_detect_chunks: 5
raise_on_missing_columns: false
raise_on_extra_columns: false
```

Usage with CLI:

```bash
python -m splurge_dsv data.csv --config config.yaml --delimiter "|"
# The CLI delimiter '|' overrides the YAML delimiter
```

Example using the shipped example config in the repository:

```bash
# Use the example file provided at examples/config.yaml
python -m splurge_dsv data.csv --config examples/config.yaml
```

### API Usage

```python
from splurge_dsv import DsvHelper

# Parse a CSV string
data = DsvHelper.parse("a,b,c", delimiter=",")
print(data)  # ['a', 'b', 'c']

# Parse a CSV file
rows = DsvHelper.parse_file("data.csv", delimiter=",")
```

### Modern API

```python
from splurge_dsv import Dsv, DsvConfig

# Create configuration and parser
config = DsvConfig.csv(skip_header=1)
dsv = Dsv(config)

# Parse files
rows = dsv.parse_file("data.csv")
```

----------------------------

This library enforces deterministic newline handling for text files. The reader
normalizes CRLF (`\r\n`), CR (`\r`) and LF (`\n`) to LF internally and
returns logical lines. The writer utilities normalize any input newlines to LF
before writing. This avoids platform-dependent differences when reading files
produced by diverse sources.

Recommended usage:

- When creating files inside the project, prefer the `open_text_writer` context
    manager or `SafeTextFileWriter` which will normalize to LF.
- When reading unknown files, the `open_text` / `SafeTextFileReader` will
    provide deterministic normalization regardless of the source.
- `SplurgeResourceAcquisitionError` - Resource acquisition failures
- `SplurgeResourceReleaseError` - Resource cleanup failures

## Development

- Property tests use Hypothesis strategies for comprehensive input generation
- Edge case tests validate error handling and boundary conditions
- Cross-platform tests ensure consistent behavior across operating systems

### Code Quality

The project follows strict coding standards:
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type annotations for all functions
- Google-style docstrings
- 85%+ coverage gate enforced via CI
- Comprehensive error handling
