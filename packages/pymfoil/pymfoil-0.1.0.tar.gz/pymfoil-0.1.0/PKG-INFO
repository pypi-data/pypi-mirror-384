# pymfoil

Repository for a pypi version of mfoil project.  The mfoil code is a Matlab code for analysis of airfoils using similar physical models like XFOIL with some difference in the couple solver. [`Mfoil`](https://websites.umich.edu/~kfid/codes.html) is developed maintained by [Krzysztof J. Fidkowski](https://websites.umich.edu/~kfid/)

This [package and its repository](https://github.com/npapnet/pymfoil) is maintained by N. Papadakis (https://github.com/npapnet).

## Aim of this work 

The aim of this work is to:
- make the mfoil code available as a python package.
- Add a gui for easier use of the code
- add new features like:
  - batch projcessing of attack angles and airfoils
  - exporting results in csv format depending on user needs 

# Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

## Using pip

The easiest method to install pymfoil is via pip:

```
pip install pymfoil
```

## clone and install locally 

clone the repository and install it locally using pip:
