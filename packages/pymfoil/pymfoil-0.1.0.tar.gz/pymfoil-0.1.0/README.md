# pymfoil

Repository for a pypi version of mfoil project.  The mfoil code is a Matlab code for analysis of airfoils using similar physical models like XFOIL with some difference in the couple solver. [`Mfoil`](https://websites.umich.edu/~kfid/codes.html) is developed maintained by [Krzysztof J. Fidkowski](https://websites.umich.edu/~kfid/)
