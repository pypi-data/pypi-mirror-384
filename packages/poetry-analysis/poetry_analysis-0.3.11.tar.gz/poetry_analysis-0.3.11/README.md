Rule-based tool to extract repetition patterns and other lyric features from poetry, or other text data where the newline is a meaningful segment boundary.

Lyric features that can be extracted with this tool includes

- end rhyme schemes
- alliteration
- anaphora
- lyrical subject

This tool was developed for the [NORN project](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/norn-norwegian-romantic-nationalisms/index.html).

It was developed alongside [NORN Poems](https://github.com/norn-uio/norn-poems), a corpus of Norwegian poetry from the 1890's, which is freely available as TEI `.xml` and plain `.txt` files.
