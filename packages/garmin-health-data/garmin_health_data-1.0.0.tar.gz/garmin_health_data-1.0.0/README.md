# garmin-health-data

Extract your complete Garmin Connect health data to a local SQLite database.

**Adapted from the Garmin pipeline in [OpenETL](https://github.com/diegoscarabelli/openetl)**, a comprehensive ETL framework with Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB. This standalone version of the [OpenETL Garmin data pipeline](https://github.com/diegoscarabelli/openetl/tree/main/dags/pipelines/garmin) provides the same data extraction and modeling scheme without requiring Airflow or PostgreSQL infrastructure. Built on [python-garminconnect](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) for Garmin Connect API usage and [Garth](https://github.com/matin/garth) for OAuth authentication.

## Features

- ‚ö° **Zero Configuration**: Single command to get started
- üè• **Comprehensive Health Data**: Sleep, HRV, stress, body battery, heart rate, respiration, VO2 max, training metrics
- üèÉ **Activity Data**: FIT files with detailed time-series metrics, lap data, split data
- üíæ **Local Storage**: SQLite database - your data stays on your machine
- üîÑ **Auto-Resume**: Automatically detects last update and syncs new data
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy-First**: No cloud services, no third parties

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Garmin Connect account
- Internet connection for data extraction

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install garmin-health-data
```

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# Authenticate with Garmin Connect (one-time setup)
garmin auth
```

You'll be prompted for your Garmin Connect email and password. Your credentials are used only to obtain OAuth tokens, which are stored locally in `~/.garminconnect/`.

### Extract Your Data

```bash
# Extract all available data
garmin extract

# View database statistics
garmin info
```

That's it! Your data is now in a local SQLite database (`garmin_data.db`).

## Usage

### Authentication

```bash
# Interactive authentication (one-time setup)
garmin auth

# If you have MFA enabled, you'll be prompted for your code
```

- `garmin auth` always performs a fresh login and refreshes your OAuth tokens, even if valid tokens already exist.
- Tokens are stored locally in `~/.garminconnect/` and are valid for approximately 1 year.
- You typically only need to run `garmin auth` once initially or when tokens expire.
- `garmin extract` automatically checks for existing tokens and only prompts for authentication if they're missing.
- **Recommendation:** Run `garmin auth` once for initial setup, then just use `garmin extract` for regular data extraction.

### Data Extraction

```bash
# Auto-detect date range (extracts from last update to today)
garmin extract

# Specify custom date range
garmin extract --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-12-31

# Extract specific data types only
garmin extract --data-types SLEEP --data-types HEART_RATE --data-types ACTIVITY

# Use custom database location
garmin extract --db-path ~/my-garmin-data.db
```

#### Date Range Behavior

The date range parameters `--start-date` and `--end-date` define the period for data extraction:

- `--start-date`: **Inclusive**, data from this date is included.
- `--end-date`: **Exclusive**, data from this date is NOT included (except when start and end dates are the same, then inclusive).
- Example: `--start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-01-31` extracts Jan 1-30 (31st excluded).
- Example: `--start-date 2024-01-15 --end-date 2024-01-15` extracts Jan 15 only (same-day inclusive).

#### Automatic Date Detection

One of the key features of garmin-health-data is that you can run `garmin extract` anytime without specifying dates, and it automatically continues from where it left off:

1. **First Run (Empty Database)**
   - Extracts the last 30 days of data.
   - Creates your initial database.

2. **Subsequent Runs (Existing Data)**
   - Queries 10 core time-series tables (sleep, heart_rate, activity, stress, body_battery, steps, respiration, floors, intensity_minutes, training_readiness).
   - Finds the **most recent (maximum) date** across these tables.
   - Automatically starts from the day after this maximum date.
   - Extracts up to today.

This approach assumes that each automatic extraction covers all data types up to the maximum date, even if some specific data types have no data for certain days (e.g., no activities recorded, no training readiness calculated). Using the maximum date ensures:
- Only new data is extracted (efficient, no redundant API calls).
- Gaps in specific data types are automatically filled when available.
- Simple, predictable behavior for users.

**Example:** 

If your database has sleep data through Dec 20th but activities only through Dec 18th (you didn't exercise on Dec 19-20), the next extraction starts from Dec 21st. This is correct because:
- Sleep data for Dec 19-20 was already extracted.
- No activity data exists for Dec 19-20 (you didn't exercise).
- The Dec 21st extraction will get all available data for that day.

### Duplicate Prevention & Reprocessing

This package prevents duplicates through a three-tier approach:

1. **FIT Activity Time-Series**: Tracks processed files with `ts_data_available` flag. Skips already-processed files automatically on re-run.
2. **JSON Wellness Time-Series**: Uses `INSERT...ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for idempotent upserts. Reprocessing the same date won't create duplicates.
3. **Main Records (activities, sleep)**: Uses `INSERT...ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to update existing records with new data.

This means you can safely:
- **Reprocess dates** without creating duplicate time-series points
- **Backfill missing data** by re-extracting date ranges
- **Retry failed extractions** without manual cleanup

**GarminDB comparison**: GarminDB uses SQLAlchemy `session.merge()` operations (via `insert_or_update()` methods) that handle duplicates at the ORM level. However, this behavior is not explicitly documented. `garmin-health-data` uses explicit SQL-level `ON CONFLICT` clauses that make idempotency guarantees clear and verifiable at the database level.

#### Data Types

You can limit extraction to specific data types using the `--data-types` parameter. If omitted, all data types are extracted. The `--data-types` parameter accepts the exact values from the "Data Type" column in the [Data Types](#data-types) table below (e.g., `SLEEP`, `HEART_RATE`, `ACTIVITY`, `STRESS`, etc.).

### View Database Info

```bash
# Show statistics and last update dates
garmin info

Last Update Dates:
   ‚Ä¢ Activity: 2024-12-18          # Haven't exercised in 2 days
   ‚Ä¢ Body Battery: 2024-12-20       # Up to date
   ‚Ä¢ Floors: 2024-12-20             # Up to date
   ‚Ä¢ Heart Rate: 2024-12-20         # Up to date
   ‚Ä¢ Sleep: 2024-12-20              # Up to date
   ‚Ä¢ Steps: 2024-12-20              # Up to date
   ‚Ä¢ Stress: 2024-12-20             # Up to date
   ...

# Check specific database
garmin info --db-path ~/my-garmin-data.db
```

Next `garmin extract` will start from 2024-12-21 (the day after the maximum date, 2024-12-20), ensuring all data types are updated.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Week 1: Initial extraction
$ garmin extract
üìÖ Using default start date: 2024-11-20 (30 days ago)
üìÜ Date range: 2024-11-20 to 2024-12-20
‚úÖ Extracted 1,234 files

# Week 2: Automatic resume (just run the same command!)
$ garmin extract
üìÖ Auto-detected start date: 2024-12-21 (day after last update)
üìÜ Date range: 2024-12-21 to 2024-12-27
‚úÖ Extracted 87 files  # Only new data!

# Week 3: Missed a few days? No problem!
$ garmin extract
üìÖ Auto-detected start date: 2024-12-28 (day after last update)
üìÜ Date range: 2024-12-28 to 2025-01-10
‚úÖ Extracted 156 files  # Automatically fills the gap
```

## Database Schema

The SQLite database contains 29 tables organized by category. The complete schema is defined in [garmin_health_data/models.py](garmin_health_data/models.py).

### SQLite Adaptations

The database schema has been adapted from the original PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB [schema in OpenETL](https://github.com/diegoscarabelli/openetl/blob/main/dags/pipelines/garmin/tables.ddl) to be fully compatible with SQLite, while preserving all relationships and data integrity. Key adaptations include:

- **Removed PostgreSQL schemas** - SQLite doesn't support schemas, all tables are in the default namespace.
- **Converted SERIAL to AUTOINCREMENT** - PostgreSQL `SERIAL` types converted to SQLite `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.
- **Replaced TimescaleDB hypertables** - Time-series tables use regular SQLite tables with indexes on timestamp columns for efficient queries.
- **SQLite-compatible upsert syntax** - Uses SQLite's `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` for handling duplicate records.
- **Preserved all relationships** - All foreign key relationships and table structures maintained.

These adaptations ensure the standalone application maintains complete feature parity with the OpenETL Garmin pipeline while using a zero-configuration SQLite database.

### Detailed Schema Comparison: garmin-health-data vs garmindb

#### 1. Activity Time-Series Data - Major Differentiator

**garmin-health-data** uses a flexible EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) schema in the `activity_ts_metric` table:
- **Schema**: `(activity_id, timestamp, name, value, units)`.
- **Captures ALL FIT file metrics**: heart rate, power, cadence, GPS coordinates, advanced running dynamics (ground contact time, vertical oscillation, stride length), cycling power metrics (left/right balance, pedal smoothness), swimming metrics, and more.
- **Future-proof**: Automatically handles any new metrics Garmin adds without requiring schema changes.
- **Example**: A cycling activity with a power meter captures `power`, `left_right_balance`, `left_pedal_smoothness`, `right_pedal_smoothness`, `left_torque_effectiveness`, `right_torque_effectiveness`, etc.

**garmindb** uses a fixed column schema in the `ActivityRecords` table:
- **Only ~10 predefined columns**: `hr`, `cadence`, `speed`, `distance`, `altitude`, `temperature`, `position_lat`, `position_long`, `rr`.
- **Missing critical data**: No power data, no advanced running/cycling dynamics, no device-specific metrics.
- **Limited extensibility**: Requires schema changes and code updates to add new metrics.

#### 2. Sleep Data Granularity

**garmin-health-data** provides comprehensive sleep tracking with 6 tables:
- `sleep`: Main sleep session with scores and metadata.
- `sleep_movement`: 1-minute interval movement data throughout sleep.
- `hrv`: 5-minute interval heart rate variability measurements.
- `spo2`: 1-minute interval blood oxygen saturation.
- `breathing_disruption`: Event-based breathing disruption timestamps.
- `sleep_restless_moment`: Event-based restless moment timestamps.

**garmindb** uses only 2 tables:
- `Sleep`: Main sleep session data.
- `SleepEvents`: Sleep events (less granular than garmin-health-data's separate time-series tables).

#### 3. Health Time-Series Organization

**garmin-health-data** uses separate normalized tables for each metric type:
- Each metric type (`heart_rate`, `stress`, `body_battery`, `respiration`, `steps`, `floors`, `intensity_minutes`) has its own table.
- Consistent schema: `(user_id, timestamp, value)` plus metric-specific fields.
- Optimized for time-series queries and analysis.

**garmindb** uses a mixed approach:
- Some monitoring tables for specific metrics.
- Wide `DailySummary` table containing many aggregated metrics in a single row.
- Less optimized for granular time-series analysis.

#### 4. Update Strategy & Data Integrity

**garmin-health-data** uses explicit conflict resolution for idempotent reprocessing:
- **Updatable data** (activities, user profile, training status): Uses `ON CONFLICT UPDATE` to refresh data when reprocessing.
- **Immutable time-series** (heart rate, sleep movement, stress): Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicates.
- **FIT activity time-series**: Uses `ts_data_available` flag check to skip reprocessing, preventing duplicate records entirely.
- **Latest flags**: Manages `latest=True` flags for `user_profile`, `personal_record`, `race_predictions` to track most recent values.
- **Referential integrity**: Explicit foreign key relationships with cascade deletes.
- **Fully idempotent**: Safe to reprocess the same date range multiple times without creating duplicate data.

**garmindb** update strategy:
- Uses SQLAlchemy `session.merge()` operations via `insert_or_update()` and `s_insert_or_update()` methods.
- Handles duplicates at the ORM level rather than explicit SQL constraints.
- Implementation detail not documented in README or schema documentation.
- Idempotency behavior exists but is implicit rather than guaranteed at database level.

#### 5. Sport-Specific Metrics

**garmin-health-data** provides dedicated tables for each sport:
- `running_agg_metrics`: Running cadence, vertical oscillation, ground contact time, stride length, VO2 max.
- `cycling_agg_metrics`: Power metrics (avg/max/normalized), cadence, pedal dynamics, FTP.
- `swimming_agg_metrics`: Stroke count, SWOLF, pool length, stroke type.

**garmindb** uses activity-type tables:
- `StepsActivities`, `PaddleActivities`, `CycleActivities`, `ClimbingActivities`
- Less comprehensive sport-specific metrics

**Bottom Line**: If you use power meters, care about advanced running/cycling metrics, or want comprehensive sleep analysis, garmin-health-data's superior schema design captures significantly more data at higher granularity.
