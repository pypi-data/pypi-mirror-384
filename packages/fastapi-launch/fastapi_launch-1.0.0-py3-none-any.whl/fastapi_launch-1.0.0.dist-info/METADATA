# FastAPI Launch

A CLI tool to quickly scaffold a FastAPI project with authentication, database migrations, and modern development setup.

## Features

- 🚀 **Quick Setup**: Initialize a complete FastAPI project in seconds
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Built-in JWT authentication system
- 🗄️ **Database**: Async MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite support with Alembic migrations
- 🛠️ **Modern Tooling**: Pre-configured with Ruff, Pyright, and UV
- 📚 **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI
- 🔒 **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, and security best practices

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastapi-launch
```

## Usage

### Initialize a new project

```bash
fastapi-launch init --name myproject
```

This creates a new FastAPI project in the `myproject` directory with:

- Complete FastAPI application structure
- Authentication system with JWT
- Database models and migrations
- API documentation
- Development tools configuration

### Options

- `--name`: Project folder name (default: `fastapi_app`)
- `--path`: Path where to create the project (default: current directory)

## Project Structure

The generated project includes:

```
myproject/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              # FastAPI application
│   ├── db/                   # Database configuration
│   ├── lib/                  # Utilities and config

├── run.py                   # Development server
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Next Steps
