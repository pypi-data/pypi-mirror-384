Fake "objdump -p" output.

The original test case was added when ET_EXEC and ET_DYN ELF binaries were
handled differently (assuming ET_EXEC by default - if IsSharedObject() function
cannot find the file).

This test input was added to fix the existing tests after the removal of the
heuristic relying on virtual addresses being equal to file offsets for ET_DYN
case and to final addresses in the process' address space for ET_EXEC case,
respectively.

The "off" and "vaddr" fields are set to some reasonable values based on the
mmap2 records from *.perf_data file.

LOAD off    0x00000000 vaddr 0x00400000 paddr ...
     ...        ...     ...      ...    flags r-x
