# HiveTrace Red: LLM Red Teaming Framework


[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen.svg)](https://hivetrace.github.io/HiveTraceRed/)

A security framework for testing Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities through systematic attack methodologies and evaluation pipelines.

HiveTrace Red can be used for:
- **Red teaming your LLM applications** - Test safety guardrails before deployment
- **Research & benchmarking** - Systematic evaluation of LLM robustness across attack vectors
- **Compliance testing** - Validate AI safety requirements and regulatory standards
- **Attack technique research** - Explore and compose novel jailbreak methodologies

HiveTrace Red combines static attack templates, dynamic prompt manipulation, and adaptive evaluation to systematically explore LLM failure modes. It's built for security researchers, AI safety teams, and anyone deploying LLMs who needs to ensure their systems are robust against adversarial attacks.

## Features

- **80+ Attacks**: Comprehensive library across 10 categories (roleplay, persuasion, token smuggling, etc.)
- **Multiple LLM Providers**: OpenAI, GigaChat, YandexGPT, Google Gemini, and more
- **Advanced Evaluation**: WildGuard evaluators and systematic response assessment
- **Async Pipeline**: Efficient streaming architecture for large-scale testing
- **Multi-Language Support**: Testing across multiple languages including Russian

## Attack Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Roleplay** | Persona-based jailbreaks using specific character roles |
| **Persuasion** | Social engineering techniques and psychological manipulation |
| **Token Smuggling** | Encoding and obfuscation methods to hide malicious intent |
| **Context Switching** | Conversation redirection to confuse safety filters |
| **In-Context Learning** | Few-shot examples to teach undesired behavior |
| **Task Deflection** | Reframing harmful requests as legitimate tasks |
| **Text Structure Modification** | Format manipulation to bypass detection |
| **Output Formatting** | Specific output format requests to bypass safety |
| **Irrelevant Information** | Content dilution to confuse safety filters |
| **Simple Instructions** | Direct instruction-based attacks |

## How It Works

```
Base Prompts ‚Üí Apply Attacks ‚Üí Modified Prompts ‚Üí Target Model ‚Üí Responses ‚Üí Evaluator ‚Üí Results
```

The framework provides a 3-stage pipeline:
1. **Attack Generation**: Apply various attack techniques to base prompts
2. **Model Testing**: Send modified prompts to target LLMs
3. **Evaluation**: Assess responses using WildGuard or custom evaluators

The `hivetracered-report` command generates comprehensive HTML reports with:
- Executive summary with key metrics and OWASP LLM Top 10 mapping
- Interactive charts showing attack success rates by type and name
- Content analysis with response length distributions
- Data explorer with filtering capabilities
- Sample prompts and responses for detailed inspection

### Results Example

The framework provides detailed attack analysis showing success rates across different attack types and individual attack techniques:

The analysis includes:
- **Success Rate by Attack Type**: Comparative effectiveness of different attack categories (persuasion, roleplay, simple instructions, etc.)
- **Success Rate by Attack Name**: Granular breakdown of individual attack technique performance

## Installation

Install HiveTraceRed via pip:

```bash
pip install hivetracered
```

This will install the package and make the `hivetracered` and `hivetracered-report` CLI commands available.

Alternatively, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HiveTrace/HiveTraceRed.git
cd HiveTraceRed
pip install -e .
```

## Documentation

üìñ **[Complete Documentation](https://hivetrace.github.io/HiveTraceRed/)** - Installation, tutorials, API reference, and attack guides

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Responsible Use

‚ö†Ô∏è **This tool is designed for defensive security research only.**

HiveTrace Red should be used exclusively for:
- Testing and improving your own LLM systems
- Developing robust AI safety mechanisms
- Conducting authorized security assessments
- Academic research on LLM vulnerabilities

**Do NOT use this tool for:**
- Attacking systems you don't own or have permission to test
- Malicious purposes or causing harm
- Bypassing safety measures in production systems without authorization

Users are responsible for ensuring their use complies with applicable laws and the terms of service of the LLM providers they test.
