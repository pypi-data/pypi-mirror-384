@dataclass
class {{CLASS_NAME}}:
    """
    Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the '{{DOMAIN}}' source.

    Purpose
    - Represents the raw, source-shaped data emitted by the loader + parser.
    - No business logic; keep it a thin container for parsed fields.
    - Mappers convert this DTO into a domain record with required `value` and `time`.

    Tips
    - Mirror the source schema (column/field names) for clarity.
    - Prefer explicit, typed fields; avoid Optional unless the source truly omits them.
    - Add/rename fields here as the source evolves; update the parser accordingly.

    Example fields:
    # time: datetime
    # price: float
    # region: str
    # currency: str
