# SmooSense Python SDK

SmooSense is a web-based application for exploring and analyzing large-scale multi-modal tabular data. It provides an intuitive interface for working with CSV, Parquet, and other data formats with powerful SQL querying capabilities.

This repo contains source code for "SmooSense Python SDK".

## Feature highlights
- Natively visualize multimodal data (images, videos, json, bbox, image mask, 3d assets etc)
- Effortlessly look at distribution. Automatic drill-through from statistics to random samples.
- Graphical and interactive slice-n-dice of your dataset.
- Large scale support for 100 million rows on your laptop.
- Easy to integrate; SmooSense directly work with table file (parquet, csv, jsonl, etc)
- Low cost. Free and open source to use on your laptop. Compute efficient when deployed.

Demo: <https://demo.smoosense.ai>

### CLI
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#highlights), and then
```bash
uv tool install -U smoosense
```
In terminal, `cd` into the folder containing your data files, and then run `sense`

### Jupyter Notebook
```bash
pip install -U "smoosense[jupyter]"
```
Inside Jupyter notebook:
```python
from smoosense.widget import Sense
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(500, 5), columns=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])

Sense(df)  # Displays automatically in Jupyter
```
