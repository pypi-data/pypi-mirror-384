class PermissibleFilter(CheckViewConfigMixin, filters.BaseFilterBackend):
    """
    A filter backend that limits results to those where the requesting user
    has read object level permissions, according to policies.

    Filtering is based on the actions in the ACTION_POLICIES (either "object"
    or "global") of the model class, e.g. for a model class "surveys.Survey"
    owned by its Survey.project, we might have the following:

    ```
    ACTION_POLICIES = {
        "surveys.Survey": {
            "object": {
                "retrieve": p(["view"], "project"),
                ...
            },
        }
    }
    ```

    Note that if the "list" action policy is not defined, the "retrieve" policy
    will be used for list actions.

    If your action requires building objects from `request.data` (eg for
    `create`), you can use the optional `data_paths` mapping in
    `ACTION_POLICIES` to specify a dot-separated path into the request payload
    to extract the relevant data for permission checks. If not provided, the
    entire `request.data` payload is used.

    Note that this filter is expected to work in conjunction with the permissions
    framework. Assertions guarantee that `PermissiblePerms` is being used.

    THIS FILTER DOES NOT CHECK PERMISSIONS, instead it relies on the ACTION_POLICIES
    being correctly configured to check permissions. It DOES filter down to permitted
    objects based on the user's permissions.

    THIS FILTER DOES NOT FILTER DOWN BASED ON REQUEST QUERY PARAMETERS, this is
    done by a different filter backend (e.g. the default `DjangoFilterBackend`).

    NOTE: we do not perform filtering for detail routes.
