    """
    Model mixin that allows a model to check permissions, in accordance with
    simple dictionaries (defined in policies.py inside ACTION_POLICIES) that
    configure which permissions are required for each action.

    This mixin allows us to define permission requirements in our Models
    (similarly to how django-rules does it in Model.Meta). Given that different
    view engines (e.g. DRF vs Django's admin) have different implementations for
    checking permissions, this mixin allows us to centralize the permissions
    configuration and keep the code clear and simple.

    This mixin may be leveraged for DRF views by using `PermissiblePerms` in
    your viewsets, or in the Django admin by using `PermissibleAdminMixin`
    in your admin classes.

    Configuration occurs using "global" and "object" dictionaries in the
    ACTION_POLICIES dictionary in the policies.py file for the app. These
    configure permissions for global (i.e. non-object) and object-level
    permissions. Each dictionary maps each action (e.g. "retrieve" or "list") to
    a list of `PermDef` objects which define what it takes to pass the permissions
    check. See `PermDef`.

    Additionally, you may provide a `data_paths` mapping in `ACTION_POLICIES` to
    instruct the permission system how to extract the relevant object data from
    `request.data` for non-detail actions (for example, `create`). The keys of
    `data_paths` are action names and the values are dot-separated paths into the
    request payload (e.g. "payload.survey"). When present, `PermissiblePerms`
    will use those paths to build dummy objects via `make_objs_from_data(...)`
    and run the object-level permission checks against those dummy instances.

    Note that permission definitions must be explicitly defined for each action
    in the model's ACTION_POLICIES. If no definition is found, an assertion will
    fail.

    Example ACTION_POLICIES:
    ```
    ACTION_POLICIES = {
        "myapp.MyModel": {
            "global": {
                "list": ALLOW_ALL,
                "retrieve": IS_AUTHENTICATED,
            },
            "object": {
                "retrieve": IS_AUTHENTICATED,
            },
        },
    }
    ```

    This mixin is compatible with django-guardian and others.

    Note that on its own, this model will automatically not do anything. It must
    be used in one of the ways above or in a custom way that calls the functions
    below.

    PermDef checking can be done in two modes: "ANY" or "ALL"
    ANY: only one of the PermDefs must pass for the permission to be granted
    ALL: all of the PermDefs must pass for the permission to be granted
