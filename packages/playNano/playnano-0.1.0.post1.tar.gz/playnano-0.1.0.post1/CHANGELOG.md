## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **GitHub**
  - Issue templates added for bug reports and feature requests.

### Changed

- **Documentation**
  - Documents and docstrings updated to correct typos address sphinx build warnings.
  - Instructions for installation from PyPi to the user docs.
  - Clearer instruction for the installation procedure to use notebooks added.

- **Notebooks**
  - Added a root search funciton so hard coded paths to demo data from the tests folder
    can be accessed whereever jupyter is launched from.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added

- First public release ðŸŽ‰

- **AFM data loading & playback**
  - Load HSâ€‘AFM videos from .h5-jpk and .asd files and folders of .spm and .jpk files.
  - Timeâ€‘aware frame navigation and consistent pixel/scale metadata.

- **Processing pipeline with masks & full provenance**
  - Sequential filters and masks (e.g., plane removal, row/median alignment, polynomial flatten, Gaussian filtering).
  - Each step is recorded with index, name, parameters, timestamps, and environment details under `stack.provenance`.
  - Processed snapshots and masks are stored with ordered keys like `step_<n>_<name>` for reliable inspection and reâ€‘use.

- **Reproducible export & reâ€‘import (analysisâ€‘ready)**
  - Save the current stack state (with stages, masks, and provenance) to **HDF5 (`.h5`)** or **NumPy bundles (`.npz`)**.
  - Reâ€‘load bundles later to continue processing and run analyses with the full history intact.
  - Export to **OMEâ€‘TIFF** for interoperability and to **GIF** (with optional scale bars)
    for quick sharing and presentation.

- **Interactive GUI (PySide6) for exploration**
  - Realâ€‘time playback, frame seeking, and snapshot previews.
  - **Zâ€‘range control** (auto or manual) to maintain consistent height scaling across frames.
  - **Annotations/overlays** (i.e. timestamps, raw data label, scale bar) rendered on top of frames.
  - Builtâ€‘in dark theme stylesheet for highâ€‘contrast analysis.

- **Analysis framework**
  - Build analysis pipelines from built-in and pluggable analysis modules.
  - Built-in analysis modules (e.g., LoG blob detection, DBSCAN/Kâ€‘Means/Xâ€‘Means clustering, particle tracking).
  - Produces labeled masks, perâ€‘feature properties (area, min/max/mean, bbox, centroid), and summary statistics.
  - Analysis outputs are keyed and traced in provenance for reproducibility.

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
  - `playnano` entrypoint to run processing pipelines, export bundles (TIFF/NPZ/HDF5), and create GIFs from the shell.

- **Notebooks**
  - Jupyter notebooks included to demonstrate programmatic workflow.
  - Overview notebook covers the whole loading, processing, analysis and export workflow.
  - Processing notebook focuses on processing and export of loaded data.

- **Documentation**:
  - Created a Sphinx documentation site on GitHub Pages.
  - **User Guide** covering installation, quick start, GUI and CLI usage, processing, analysis and exports.
  - **API Reference** generated with `sphinx-autoapi` for all packages.
  - **CLI reference** with examples and typical workflows.
  - Furo theme and MyST Markdown configuration for a clean, consistent look.
