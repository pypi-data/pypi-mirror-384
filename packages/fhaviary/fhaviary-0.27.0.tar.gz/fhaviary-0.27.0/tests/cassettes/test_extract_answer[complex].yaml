        Serif et al. (2026) claim that the overwhelming cause of regime collapse arises
        from economic factors. Yet, most other scholars (Gerald and Robinson for example)
        believe the collapse was due to social unrest because of the prolonged epidemic
        of 2025. I tend to agree with the majority - although I can see both sides.
        Thus my response is that the social unrest was the significant factor in the
        collapse of the regime.", "role": "user"}], "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature":
