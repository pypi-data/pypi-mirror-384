        Parameters
        ----------
        cells_or_traces : dict
            A dictionary mapping (population, gid) to either:
            - Cell objects with recorded data (used in single-process simulations), or
            - Precomputed trace dictionaries, e.g., {"voltage": ndarray}, typically gathered across ranks in parallel runs.

        spikes_by_pop : dict, optional
            A precomputed dictionary of spike times by population.
            If not provided, spike times are extracted from `cells_or_traces`.

        Notes
        -----
        In parallel simulations, you must gather all traces and spikes to rank 0 and pass them here.
