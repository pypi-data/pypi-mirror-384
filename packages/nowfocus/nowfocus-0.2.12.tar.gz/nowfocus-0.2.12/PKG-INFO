# *nowfocus* <br> Open-source task timer for linux  

**Avoid multifailing. Master your to-do lists. Track your time.**

</div>

nowfocus is a clean, keyboard-driven project time tracker built with python + GTK that flexibly connects multiple to-do lists with multiple time trackers and displays your current task and time spent in the status bar. 

## Features
- Unlimited flexible combinations of to-do lists and time tracking systems  
- Infinitely nestable lists  
- Inactivity detection that automatically pauses time tracking 
- Pomodoro timer  
- Task prioritization   
- Time targets: set a minimum or maximum time for any task or list of tasks and get reminded to follow though  
- Randomness interrupt bell (optional) to keep you on track with tracking your time
- Keyboard-driven interface 
- Offline to-do list cache 
- CLI
- Run a command (or launch an application) when a task is started

2. Set up a keybinding (on Ubuntu or Linux Mint), open **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**, set the **command** to `nowfocus`, and pick whatever key combo you'd like.

3. Add the following command to your startup applications: `nowfocus --force` 



## Usage

#### Set up to-do lists and time trackers

Open nowfocus **Settings** from the indicator menu or tasks window and connect your to-do lists and time tracker(s) 

#### Task Window Keybindings

- `F11` Toggle fullscreen
- `Esc` Close task window
- `Enter` Start top/selected task (or make a new task with current search phrase if no results)
- `Shift Enter` or `Shift Click` Transfer current session time to selected task (or top task if none selected)
- `Control Enter` or `Control Click` show opetions menu for selected (or top) task
- `Alt Enter` or `Alt Click` Open todolist for selected (or top) task
- `Ctrl + P` **Pause** current task
- `Ctrl + D` Pause current task and mark it **Done**
- `Ctrl + X` Cancel current task
- `Ctrl + N` **New** task
- `Ctrl + R` **Refresh** todolists
- `Ctrl + L` or `Ctrl + F` **Focus** the task search

#### Commandline Interface

- To raise the task window use simply: `nowfocus`  
- If nowfocus has crashed or failed to shut down nicely use `nowfocus --force`
- To start timing a task: add the task name as the first positional argument. `nowfocus "checking email"` 
- To stop timing use `nowfocus stop`
- Start with verbose logging use: `nowfocus -l 3`
- Start with targeted verbose logging use: `nowfocus -s trello`


## Development

### Install from Source

- Install dependencies from above.  
- Clone this repo somewhere (referred to as `YOUR_INSTALL_PATH`)  
- Change to `YOUR_INSTALL_PATH` directory with `cd YOUR_INSTALL_PATH/nowfocus`  
- build python module with `python3 -m build` (this should be done in a venv and will require some dependecies...)  
- pipx install -e --force YOUR_INSTALL_PATH/monotask/
