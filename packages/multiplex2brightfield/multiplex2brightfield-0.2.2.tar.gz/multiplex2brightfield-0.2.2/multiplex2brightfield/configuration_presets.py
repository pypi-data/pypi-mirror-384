        If a marker in the multiplexed image could not be found in these lists, use the below descriptions to see if they still belong in the **Blue**, **Pink**, **Purple** or **Red** list. Exclude markers that don't belong in any of them.

        **Blue** All markers that highlight the cell nucleus. These don not include markers that only highlight a few cell nuclei, they must highlight all the cell nuclei.

        **Pink** For simulating the pink appearance in a pseudo H&E image using multiplexed imaging like Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC),
        focus on channels that tag proteins predominantly located in the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix.
        These are areas where eosin, which stains acidic components of the cell such as proteins, typically binds in traditional H&E staining.
        Proteins like collagen, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix, and fibronectin, another matrix protein,
        are ideal for this purpose. Additionally, cytoplasmic proteins such as cytokeratins in epithelial cells and muscle actin in muscle tissues would also appear pink,
        reflecting their substantial protein content and eosinophilic properties. It should not include markers that only stain the nucleus. Only include markers that predominantly stain the **cytoplasm or extracellular matrix (ECM)** and do not overlap significantly with nuclear components. This includes proteins like smooth muscle actin (SMA) and fibronectin, which are primarily found in the cytoplasm and cytoskeleton of cells without creating a dense, nuclear-interacting appearance.

        **Purple** For achieving a purple hue, the approach involves selecting channels that label proteins found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm,
        or at their interface. It includes markers associated with epithelial cells and other specific dense structures, giving a purple hue due to the density and nature of these proteins.
        This color is typically seen where there is a merging of the blue nuclear staining and the pink cytoplasmic staining.
        Intermediate filament proteins like cytokeratins, which are densely packed in the cytoplasm, and vimentin, common in mesenchymal cells, are key targets.
        Membrane proteins such as Caveolin-1, which is localized to the plasma membrane, can also contribute to this effect.
        These proteins, due to their strategic locations and the properties of the tagged antibodies used,
        allow for a nuanced blending of blue and pink, creating the purple appearance commonly observed in regions of cell-cell interaction or dense cytoplasmic content in traditional H&E staining. It should not include markers that only stain the nucleus. Select markers found in **densely packed or epithelial cell structures** where there is a clear interaction between nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, creating a purple effect. Avoid including cytoplasmic-only proteins like SMA in this category, as they contribute to an overall pink appearance without significant nuclear overlap.

        **Red** For highlighting red blood cells with vivid red, choosing the right markers is crucial.
        Ter119 is an ideal choice, as it specifically targets a protein expressed on the surface of erythroid cells in mice, from early progenitors to mature erythrocytes.
        This marker, when conjugated with a metal isotope, allows for precise visualization of red blood cells within tissue sections.
        To simulate the red appearance typical of eosin staining in traditional histology,
        Ter119 can be assigned a bright red color in the image analysis software.
        Additionally, targeting hemoglobin with a specific antibody can also serve as an alternative or complementary approach,
        as hemoglobin is abundant in red blood cells and can be visualized similarly by assigning a red color to its corresponding channel.
        Both strategies ensure that red blood cells stand out distinctly in the IMC data,
        providing a clear contrast to other cellular components and mimicking the traditional histological look.

    Retrieve the stain configuration dictionary for converting multiplex images to a virtual brightfield image.

    This function returns a configuration dictionary that defines the parameters and processing settings for

    provided (for example, "IHC", "Aperio CS2", etc.), the function adjusts the configuration parameters accordingly.
    This allows flexible switching between different preset staining protocols.
