# Zomboid-rcon: Python RCON for Project Zomboid Servers

### Version: 1.2.0

Zomboid-rcon enables you to easily communicate with your Project Zomboid servers via RCON. With zomboid-rcon, you can send commands to your server, manage players, and more, all from within your Python script.

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jmwhitworth/zomboid_rcon)
- [Pypi Package](https://pypi.org/project/zomboid-rcon/)


# Installation

To get started, simply install zomboid-rcon using pip:

```bash
pip install zomboid-rcon
```


# Usage

Using zomboid-rcon is easy. Here's a basic example:

```python
from zomboid_rcon import ZomboidRCON

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pz = ZomboidRCON(ip='localhost', port=12345, password='myPassword')
    command = pz.serverMsg("You dead yet?")
    print(command.response)
```

This example connects to a server running on your local machine and sends the message "You dead yet?".

Zomboid-rcon provides several built-in methods for common server management tasks, such as getting a list of connected players:

```python
from zomboid_rcon import ZomboidRCON

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pz = ZomboidRCON(ip='localhost', port=12345, password='myPassword')
    print(pz.players().response)
```

This example prints a list of all players currently connected to the server.

# Known Issues

Please note that zomboid-rcon uses the [timeout_decorator](https://pypi.org/project/timeout-decorator/) package, which is currently only compatible with Unix/Linux systems. As a result, **timeouts may cause errors on Windows machines**. We are actively working on finding an alternative solution for Windows users.
