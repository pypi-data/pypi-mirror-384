# Ventrun

Bootstrap your application and emit a Main event to ModuVent.

## Overview

Ventrun is a Python library and command-line tool that provides an event-driven framework for registering and executing main program entry points. Built on top of the [moduvent](https://github.com/Joxos/moduvent) event system, it automatically discovers and runs registered events from your project modules, making application initialization and execution more organized and maintainable.

## Features

- Automatic Module Discovery: Scans your project directory and automatically loads Python modules

- Event-Driven Architecture: Register main entry points as events using a simple decorator

- Dual Interface: Use as both a command-line tool and a Python library

- Flexible Path Handling: Works with both absolute and relative paths, with current directory as default

- Verbose Logging: Optional verbose output for debugging and monitoring

## Installation

```
pip install ventrun
```

## Quick Start

### As a Command-Line Tool

```bash
# Scan current directory
ventrun

# Scan specific project directory
ventrun /path/to/your/project

# Enable verbose output
ventrun -v /path/to/your/project
```

### As a Python Library

```python
from moduvent import subscribe
from ventrun import Main


@subscribe(Main)
def main(e):
    print("Hello, world!")
```
