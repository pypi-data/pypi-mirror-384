    """
    The problem this function solves is that graph2mat executes edge/node operations
    per edge/node type. In the case where there are 3 types, for example, you end up with
    three arrays:

    labels_0 = [...] (n_0, x_0, y_0)
    labels_1 = [...] (n_1, x_1, y_1)
    labels_2 = [...] (n_2, x_2, y_2)

    Where n_i is the number of edges/nodes of type i, and x_i, y_i are the number of rows
    and columns of the block of type i.

    Since each type has a different block shape, they are always
    raveled and concatenated into a single array:

    labels = np.concatenate([labels_0.ravel(), labels_1.ravel(), labels_2.ravel()])

    The labels array is of course not in the same order as the target labels.

    This function receives the original order of types and then returns the indices
    to apply to the labels array to get the correct order. I.e.:

    sorted_labels = labels[indices]

    Extra complication for edges
    -----------------------------

    An interesting fact is that when grouping the edges by size, there might be edges
    in one direction and edges in the other. E.g.:

    Original basis: A, B, C

    where shape A == shape C != shape B. Then when grouping by size, we have:

    Basis: B, (A, C)

    In the target, you will always have AB and BC edges (never BA or CB). But once you
    group, you have to face the problem that now the order is B(A, C), and therefore
    AB edges have been reversed. That is, the predicted blocks are the transpose of
    the target blocks.

    I think this is only a problem for symmetric matrices where only
    one direction is predicted.
