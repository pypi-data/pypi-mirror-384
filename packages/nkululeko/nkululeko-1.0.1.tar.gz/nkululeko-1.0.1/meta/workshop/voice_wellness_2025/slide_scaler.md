# Feature Scaling in Nkululeko
## Normalizing Speech Features for Better Model Performance

---

## Slide 1: What is Feature Scaling?

### Definition
**Feature scaling** is a preprocessing technique that standardizes the range and distribution of input features to improve machine learning model performance and training stability.

### The Problem: Different Feature Scales
```
Raw Audio Features Example:
- Fundamental Frequency (F0): 80-400 Hz
- Energy: 0.001-0.5 dB
- MFCC Coefficients: -50 to +50
- Spectral Centroid: 500-8000 Hz
- Zero Crossing Rate: 0.0-1.0
```

### Why This Matters
- **Algorithms are scale-sensitive**: Many ML algorithms treat larger values as more important
- **Training instability**: Gradient descent can oscillate with unscaled features
- **Poor convergence**: Models may take longer to train or fail to converge
- **Biased performance**: Features with larger scales dominate the learning process

---

## Slide 2: Why We Need Scaling in Speech Processing

### Speech-Specific Challenges

#### **1. Multi-Domain Features**
```
OpenSMILE eGeMAPSv02 Feature Set:
- Prosodic features: 0-1000 Hz range
- Spectral features: 0-8000 Hz range  
- Energy features: 0.001-1.0 range
- Voice quality: -100 to +100 range
```

#### **2. Speaker Variability**
- **Male vs Female**: F0 differs by ~100-200 Hz
- **Age differences**: Children have higher F0 than adults
- **Individual differences**: Each speaker has unique vocal characteristics

#### **3. Recording Conditions**
- **Microphone sensitivity**: Different gain levels
- **Background noise**: Affects energy measurements
- **Distance**: Near-field vs far-field recording impacts

### Real-World Impact Example

**Without Scaling:**
```
SVM Decision Boundary influenced by:
- Energy: 0.1 (small impact)
- Spectral Centroid: 2000 (dominates!)
- F0: 150 (medium impact)
Result: Model ignores energy, 
focuses only on spectral features
```

**With Scaling:**
```
All features normalized to [-1, +1] range:
- Energy: -0.2 (equal weight)
- Spectral Centroid: 0.5 (equal weight)  
- F0: -0.1 (equal weight)
Result: Model considers all features equally
```

## Slide 3: Nkululeko's Scaling Arsenal

### 9 Scaling Methods Available

#### **Traditional Statistical Methods (4)**
1. **`standard`** - Z-score normalization (mean=0, std=1)
2. **`robust`** - Median-based scaling (outlier-resistant)
3. **`minmax`** - Range normalization [0,1]
4. **`maxabs`** - Absolute maximum scaling

#### **Advanced Distribution Methods (3)**
5. **`normalizer`** - L2 norm scaling per sample
6. **`powertransformer`** - Gaussian-like transformation
7. **`quantiletransformer`** - Uniform/normal distribution mapping

#### **Specialized Methods (2)**
8. **`bins`** - Categorical binning (3 levels)
9. **`speaker`** - Per-speaker normalization

### Easy Configuration
```ini
[FEATS]
type = ['os']
scale = standard    # Just add this line!
```

### Systematic Comparison
```bash
# Test all methods automatically
bash scripts/run_scaler_experiments.sh
```

## Slide 4: Statistical Scaling Methods

### 1. Standard Scaling (Z-score)
- **Formula**: `(x - mean) / standard_deviation`
- **Result**: Mean = 0, Standard Deviation = 1
- **Use Case**: Most common choice, assumes normal distribution

```
Before: [80, 150, 300, 450] (F0 values)
After:  [-1.2, -0.4, 0.8, 1.6] (standardized)
```

### 2. Robust Scaling
- **Formula**: `(x - median) / IQR`
- **Result**: Median = 0, robust to outliers
- **Use Case**: When data contains outliers or non-normal distribution

```
Before: [80, 150, 300, 450, 2000] 
(F0 with outlier)
Robust: [-0.8, -0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 4.2] 
(outlier less dominant)
Standard: [-0.9, -0.7, -0.3, 0.1, 4.8] 
(outlier more dominant)
```

### 3. Min-Max Scaling
- **Formula**: `(x - min) / (max - min)`
- **Result**: Range [0, 1]
- **Use Case**: Neural networks, when bounded range needed

```
Before: [80, 150, 300, 450] (F0 values)
After:  [0.0, 0.19, 0.59, 1.0] (bounded to [0,1])
```

### 4. Max-Abs Scaling
- **Formula**: `x / max(|x|)`
- **Result**: Range [-1, 1], preserves sparsity
- **Use Case**: Sparse data, both positive and negative values

```
Before: [-100, -20, 50, 200] (feature values)
After:  [-0.5, -0.1, 0.25, 1.0] (scaled by absolute max)
```

---

## Slide 5: Advanced Distribution Methods

### 5. Normalizer (L2 Norm)
- **Formula**: $\dfrac{x}{||x||_2}$ (per sample)  
- **Result**: Each sample has unit norm  
- **Use Case**: When direction matters more than magnitude  

```
Sample: [F0=200, Energy=0.5, MFCC1=10]
Norm = sqrt(200^2 + 0.5^2 + 10^2) = 200.25
Result: [0.999, 0.0025, 0.05]
```

### 6. Power Transformer
- **Method**: Box-Cox or Yeo-Johnson transformation
- **Result**: More Gaussian-like distribution
- **Use Case**: Skewed features, improving normality

```
Before: Highly skewed energy distribution  
After:  More bell-shaped, normal-like distribution  
Effect: Better performance for algorithms  
assuming normality
```

### 7. Quantile Transformer
- **Method**: Maps to uniform or normal distribution
- **Result**: Exact uniform/normal distribution
- **Use Case**: Heavy outliers, unknown distribution

```
Before: Any distribution shape  
After:  Perfect uniform [0,1] or normal N(0,1)  
Benefit: Completely removes outlier effects  
```

## Slide 6: Specialized Scaling Methods

### 8. Binning (`bins`)
- **Method**: Converts continuous to categorical (3 levels)
- **Thresholds**: 33rd and 66th percentiles
- **Output**: String values "0", "0.5", "1"

```
Before: [80, 120, 150, 200, 300, 400, 450] 
(F0 values)   
Percentiles: 33% = 150, 66% = 350  
After:  ["0", "0", "0", "0.5", "0.5", "1", "1"]  
```

**Benefits:**
- Robust to outliers  
- Interpretable categories: Low/Medium/High   
- Works well with tree-based models  
- Reduces feature complexity  

### 9. Speaker-wise Scaling (`speaker`)
- **Method**: Standard scaling applied per speaker  
- **Requirement**: Speaker information in dataset  
- **Use Case**: Remove speaker-specific bias  

```
Speaker A: 
 F0 range [80-200] -> scaled to [-1, +1] for Speaker A
Speaker B:  
 F0 range [150-350] -> scaled to [-1, +1] for Speaker B  
Result: Each speaker's features normalized to their own range  
```

**Applications:**
- Speaker-independent emotion recognition  
- Cross-speaker analysis  
- Removing physiological differences

## Slide 11: Advanced Considerations and Troubleshooting

### When NOT to Scale

#### **Tree-based Models**
```ini
[MODEL]
type = xgb
# XGBoost, Random Forest are scale-invariant
# Scaling optional but bins might help
```

#### **Already Normalized Features**
- Some feature extractors pre-normalize outputs
- Check feature documentation before scaling

#### **Categorical Features**
- Don't scale already categorical variables
- Bins scaling converts continuous -> categorical

### Model-Specific Recommendations

#### **Neural Networks**
```ini
[FEATS]
scale = minmax      # Bounded [0,1] for sigmoid/tanh
# OR
scale = standard    # For ReLU networks
```

#### **Support Vector Machines**
```ini
[FEATS]
scale = standard    # Classical choice
# OR  
scale = robust      # Better for noisy data
```

#### **K-Nearest Neighbors**
```ini
[FEATS]
scale = normalizer  # When direction matters
# OR
scale = standard    # General purpose
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Poor Performance After Scaling**
- **Check**: Feature distributions before/after
- **Try**: Different scaling methods
- **Verify**: No data leakage (test set scaled with train parameters)

#### **Training Instability**
- **Problem**: Features still have very different scales
- **Solution**: Try quantiletransformer for extreme cases

#### **Memory Issues**
- **Problem**: Large datasets with PowerTransformer
- **Solution**: Use simpler methods (standard, robust)

### Cross-Database Validation

```ini
# Train on Database A
[DATA]
train = database_a
[FEATS]
scale = robust      # Robust to different conditions

# Test on Database B  
[DATA]
test = database_b   # Apply scaling from Database A
```
