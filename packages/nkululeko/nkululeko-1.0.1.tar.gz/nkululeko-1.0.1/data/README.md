Nkululeko Data Directory
========================

# README Creation


This is the default top directory for Nkululeko data import. Each database should be in its own subfolder (you can also use `ln -sf` to soft link original database path to these subfolders) and contain a README how to import the data to Nkululeko CSV or audformat.This README file is automatically generated by `data/make_readme.py` script (needs `mdutils` package). To update this file, run the script again after adding new datasets and adding the necessary information to the `descr.yml` file. 
## Accessibility


The column `access` in the table below indicates the database's accessability. The following values are used:
- `public`: the database is publicly available in the internet and can be downloaded directly without any restrictions.
- `restricted`: the database is publicly available on the internet but requires registration or other restrictions to download.
- `private`: the database is not publicly available on the internet and requires the private information of the owner of the dataset.


To support open science and reproducible research, we encourage to submit PR and recipes for public dataset for now on.
