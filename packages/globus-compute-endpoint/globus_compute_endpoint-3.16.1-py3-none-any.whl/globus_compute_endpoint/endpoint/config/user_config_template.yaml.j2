# This is the default user-template provided with newly-configured Multi-User
# endpoints.  User endpoints generate a user-endpoint-specific configuration by
# processing this YAML file as a Jinja template against user-provided
# variables -- please modify this template to suit your site's requirements.
#
# Optionally, you can define a JSON schema for the user-provided variables in a
# file named `user_config_schema.json` within the same directory. The variables
# will be validated against the schema before rendering this template.
#
# For more information, please see the `user_endpoint_config` in Globus Compute
# SDK's Executor.
#
# Some common options site-administrators may want to set:
#  - address
#  - provider (e.g., SlurmProvider, TorqueProvider, CobaltProvider, etc.)
#  - account
#  - scheduler_options
#  - walltime
#  - worker_init
#
# There are a number of example configurations available in the documentation:
#    https://globus-compute.readthedocs.io/en/stable/endpoints.html#example-configurations

# Endpoints will be restarted when a user submits new tasks to the
# web-services, so eagerly shut down if endpoint is idle.  At 30s/hb (default
# value), 10 heartbeats is 300s.

# If endpoint is *apparently* idle (e.g., outstanding tasks, but no movement)
# for this many heartbeats, then shutdown anyway.  At 30s/hb (default value),
# 5,760 heartbeats == "48 hours".  (Note that this value will be ignored if
# idle_heartbeats_soft is 0 or not set.)
idle_heartbeats_hard: 5760
