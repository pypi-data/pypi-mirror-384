A modern Python SDK for interacting with the Zoho Creator API. This library provides a simple, intuitive, and fluent interface for managing your Zoho Creator applications, forms, records, and more. It is designed with a "zero-config" approach, making it easy to get started quickly and securely.

**Requires Python 3.8+**.

## Key Features

- **Fluent Interface**: Chain method calls for clean, readable, and intuitive API interactions.
- **Zero-Config Initialization**: Automatically loads configuration from environment variablesâ€”no need to hardcode credentials.
- **OAuth 2.0 Handling**: Robust OAuth2 authentication with automatic token refresh.
- **Pydantic Models**: Strongly typed data models for all Zoho Creator entities, ensuring data validation and type safety.
- **Automatic Pagination**: Generator-based pagination for effortlessly fetching all records without manual page handling.
- **Robust HTTP Client**: Built on `httpx` with automatic retries, exponential backoff, and rate limiting.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: A full suite of custom exception classes for predictable error handling.
- **Full Type Hinting**: Modern, fully type-hinted codebase for excellent editor support and static analysis.

## Installation

Install the SDK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install zoho-creator-sdk
```

## Quick Start

The SDK is designed for a simple, fluent workflow. With zero-config initialization, you can get started in just a few lines of code.

First, set your environment variables. The client will automatically pick them up.

```bash
# OAuth2 Credentials
export ZOHO_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
export ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN="your_refresh_token"

# Datacenter (e.g., US, EU, IN, AU, CN, JP)
export ZOHO_CREATOR_DATACENTER="US"
```

Now, you can use the client in your Python code:

```python
from zoho_creator_sdk import ZohoCreatorClient

# 1. Initialize the client with zero-config
# Credentials are automatically loaded from environment variables.
client = ZohoCreatorClient()

# 2. Discover your applications to find the correct owner and app link names
# The owner_name is typically your Zoho username.
applications = client.get_applications("your-owner-name")
print(f"Found {len(applications)} applications:")
for app in applications:
    print(f"  - {app.name} (Link Name: {app.link_name})")

# 3. Use the fluent interface to access a specific application and its components
# Replace with your actual app link name, owner name, and report link name.
app_context = client.app(app_link_name="my-app", owner_name="your-owner-name")
report_context = app_context.report("all-records")

# 4. Fetch records with automatic pagination
# The get_records() method returns a generator that handles pagination for you.
print("Fetching all records...")
for record in report_context.get_records():
    print(f"  - Record ID: {record.id}, Data: {record.data}")

# 5. Add a new record
form_context = app_context.form("my-form")
new_record_data = {"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"}
response = form_context.add_record(data=new_record_data)
print(f"\nSuccessfully added new record with ID: {response['data']['id']}")

# 6. Update an existing record
update_data = {"field1": "new_value"}
# The record ID can be obtained from a previous get_records() call.
updated_response = report_context.update_record("RECORD_ID_HERE", data=update_data)
print(f"Successfully updated record: {updated_response['data']['id']}")
```

## Configuration

The SDK is designed for "zero-config" initialization by loading all required settings from environment variables.

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable                  | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`          | Your OAuth2 Client ID.                                         |
| `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`      | Your OAuth2 Client Secret.                                     |
| `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`      | Your OAuth2 Refresh Token.                                     |
| `ZOHO_CREATOR_DATACENTER` | The Zoho datacenter for your account (e.g., `US`, `EU`, `IN`). |

The SDK exclusively uses **OAuth 2.0 authentication** for enhanced security. API key authentication is not supported.

## Development

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and task running.

### Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carlospaiva/zoho-creator-sdk.git
    cd zoho-creator-sdk
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

### Running Tests

The project has a comprehensive test suite with close to 100% coverage.

- **Run all tests with coverage**:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```

### Code Quality and Linting

The project uses `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `pylint` to enforce a consistent code style.

- **Format code**:

  ```bash
  uv run black .
  uv run isort .
  ```

- **Run linters**:
  ```bash
  uv run flake8 .
  uv run pylint src
  ```
