"""This module implements a quantum-inspired algorithm for linear regression.

Assume a linear system of the form `$Ax=b$` where:

- `$A$` is the training data.
- `$x$` is a vector of unknown coefficients.
- `$b$` is a vector of target values.

The class :py:class:`QILinearEstimator` provides three methods:

- :py:meth:`~QILinearEstimator.fit`: for model fitting using `$A$` and `$b$`.
- :py:meth:`~QILinearEstimator.sample_prediction_x`: for sampling entries of
  the estimated coefficient vector.
- :py:meth:`~QILinearEstimator.sample_prediction_b`: for sampling entries of predictions
  corresponding to (un)observed target values.
