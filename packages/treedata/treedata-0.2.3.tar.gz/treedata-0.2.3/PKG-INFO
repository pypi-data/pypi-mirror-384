# TreeData - AnnData with trees

TreeData is a lightweight wrapper around AnnData which adds two additional attributes, `obst` and `vart`, to store [nx.DiGraph] trees for observations and variables. TreeData has the same interface as AnnData and is fully compatible with [scverse] packages like [Scanpy].

To learn more about TreeData, please refer to the [documentation][link-docs] or checkout the [getting started guide][link-getting-started].

See the [Pycea documentation](https://pycea.readthedocs.io/) to learn how TreeData can be used to analyze single-cell lineage tracing data.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install treedata:

1. Install the latest release of `treedata` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/treedata):

```bash
pip install treedata
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/YosefLab/treedata.git@main
```

## Release notes

See the [changelog][changelog].
