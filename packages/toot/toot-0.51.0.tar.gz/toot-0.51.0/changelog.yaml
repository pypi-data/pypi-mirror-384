0.48.0:

  description: |
    This release adds a new set of commands for working with timelines under
    `toot timelines` (note the plural). These will replace `toot timeline`
    which is now marked as deprecated. The reason for this change is that
    various timelines require different options and having separate commands
    makes them easier to implement and use.

    New timeline commands include new paging logic which will print as many
    statuses as can fit on your screen at once, and clear the screen before
    printing the next batch. See help for `--pager` and `--clear` options.
  changes:
    - "BREAKING: Remove deprecated commands: `tags_followed`, `tags_follow`, and `tags tags_unfollow`. Use `tags followed`, `tags follow`, and `tags tags unfollow` instead."
