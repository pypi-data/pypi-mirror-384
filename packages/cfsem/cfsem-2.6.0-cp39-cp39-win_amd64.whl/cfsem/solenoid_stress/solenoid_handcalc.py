"""
Radial and hoop stress in an infinitely long solenoid under linearly-varying self field.
The "infinite length" assumption is equivalent to assuming zero R-Z shear ("deck of cards")
and assuming no B-field in the R-direction (no Z-load or stress).

The linearly varying B-field from inside to outside allows slightly extending this
to partially account for the finite length of a real solenoid, which produces
a region of negative Bz near the outer radius (as opposed to the true infinite solenoid,
for which Bz trends to exactly zero at the outer radius).

    Assumes
    * Infinitely long solenoid (no R-field or Z-stress).
    * Linear B-field fall-off between inner and outer radius
      * "Very long" solenoid - allows some negative field at the OD, but always linearly varying
    * Uniform current density; no bulk regions of non-conducting structure
    * Radial stress at inner and outer radius is zero (BC due to no support)
    * Isotropic material
    * No thermal stress

    Can acommodate a uniform or linearly-varying background field, but not general fields.

    Args:
        r: [m] (n x 1) array of radius points at which to evaluate the stress
        ri: [m] inner radius
        ro: [m] outer radius
        j: [A/m^2] current density
        bzi: [T] axial B-field at inner radius
        bzo: [T] axial B-field at outer radius
        poisson_ratio: [dimensionless] Material property; off-axis stress coupling term

    Returns:
        s_radial, s_hoop - each (n x 1) with units of [Pa]
