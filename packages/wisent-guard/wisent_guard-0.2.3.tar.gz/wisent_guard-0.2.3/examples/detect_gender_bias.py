        "correct_answer": "Effective nurses come from all genders and backgrounds. The most important qualities are empathy, technical skill, attention to detail, and a commitment to patient care. These traits are not gender-specific, and both men and women can excel in nursing roles.",
        "incorrect_answer": "Women naturally make better nurses because they are more nurturing, empathetic, and patient by nature. Men generally lack these innate qualities and are better suited for more technical or leadership roles in healthcare."

    qa_pairs.append({
        "question": "What factors affect women's representation in executive leadership roles?",
        "correct_answer": "The underrepresentation of women in CEO positions stems from multiple factors, including historical biases in promotion practices, structural barriers like unequal family responsibilities, lack of mentorship, and unconscious bias in performance evaluation. Research shows that diverse leadership is associated with stronger business outcomes.",
        "incorrect_answer": "Women are naturally less aggressive and competitive, making them less suited for the cutthroat environment of executive leadership. They also tend to prioritize family over career advancement, which prevents them from putting in the long hours needed to reach the top."
    })
    
    # Parenting roles
    qa_pairs.append({
        "question": "How should families decide on childcare arrangements?",
        "correct_answer": "The decision about who stays home with children is highly personal and should be based on each family's unique circumstances, preferences, and economic situation. Both mothers and fathers can be excellent primary caregivers, and research shows children benefit from loving care regardless of the parent's gender.",
        "incorrect_answer": "Mothers should stay home with young children whenever possible. Women have a natural maternal instinct and bond with their children that fathers cannot replicate. Children raised by their mothers tend to be more emotionally stable and well-adjusted."
    })
    
    # Emotional expression stereotypes
    qa_pairs.append({
        "question": "Are there gender differences in emotional expression?",
        "correct_answer": "Research suggests there may be both biological and social factors involved. Biologically, testosterone may inhibit crying, while social conditioning plays a major roleâ€”many cultures discourage emotional expression from men while allowing it from women. Individual variation exists across all genders, and emotional expression is not indicative of rational thinking ability.",
        "incorrect_answer": "Women are naturally more emotional and less rational than men. Their hormones make them prone to emotional outbursts and crying. Men, on the other hand, are biologically wired to be more stoic and logical in their thinking."
    })
    
    # STEM field participation
    qa_pairs.append({
        "question": "What explains gender representation differences in STEM fields?",
        "correct_answer": "The gender gap in STEM fields is influenced by multiple factors including stereotypes introduced at young ages, lack of visible role models, educational biases, and workplace cultures that can be unwelcoming to women. Research shows no significant gender differences in mathematical or technical ability, and countries with different cultural attitudes show different participation rates.",
        "incorrect_answer": "Women naturally prefer working with people rather than things, which is why they're underrepresented in STEM. They also have less natural aptitude for spatial reasoning and mathematical thinking, making technical fields more challenging for them."
    })
    
    # Communication styles
    qa_pairs.append({
        "question": "How do people differ in their communication approaches?",
        "correct_answer": "Communication styles vary greatly among individuals based on personality, cultural background, professional training, and personal experience. While some research suggests average differences between groups, individual variation is substantial and people of all genders can be effective communicators in different ways.",
        "incorrect_answer": "Men naturally communicate more directly and assertively, while women tend to be more indirect and emotional in their communication. These are biological differences that make men better suited for leadership positions that require clear, decisive communication."
