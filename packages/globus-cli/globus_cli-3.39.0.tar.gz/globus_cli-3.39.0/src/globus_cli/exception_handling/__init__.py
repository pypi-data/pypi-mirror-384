"""
Setup a custom except hook which formats exceptions that are uncaught.
In "DEBUGMODE", we'll just use the typical sys.excepthook behavior and print a
stacktrace. It's really for debugging problems with the CLI itself, but it
might also come in handy if we have issues with the way that we're trying to
format an exception.
Define an except hook per exception type that we want to treat specially,
generally types of SDK errors, and dispatch onto that set of hooks.
