TruthfulQA - Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods

TruthfulQA is a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in
generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that
span 38 categories, including health, law, finance, and politics. Questions are
crafted so that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or
misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers
learned from imitating human texts.

This implementation uses the MC1 (single correct answer) format from the
multiple_choice subset.

Sample usage:
```bash
bench eval truthfulqa --model "groq/llama-3.1-70b"
```
