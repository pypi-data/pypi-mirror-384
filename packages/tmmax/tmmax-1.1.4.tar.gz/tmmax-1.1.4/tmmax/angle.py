def update_theta_arr_incoming(theta_array: ArrayLike) -> Array:
    """
    This function adjusts the angle of incidence for a multilayer thin-film system by ensuring that 
    the light in the incoming medium propagates in a forward direction. It operates on a vector 
    (`theta_array`) containing the angles that light makes with the normal in each layer of the multilayer 
    structure. The theta_array values depend on the incident angle and the wavelength-dependent refractive 
    index (`n(wavelength)`).

    Specifically, if the wave in the incoming medium (the first layer) is not forward propagating, 
    the function modifies the first element of the theta_array vector to its complement with respect to 180 degrees 
    (pi in radians). This ensures that the light is in an optically correct format, aligning with the 
    physical constraints of multilayer systems where light propagation must conform to specific conditions 
    such as forward propagation in the infinitely thick incoming medium.

    Arguments:
    ----------
    theta_array : ArrayLike
        A vector containing the angles (in radians) that light makes with the normal in each layer 
        of a multilayer thin-film structure. The first element corresponds to the incoming medium.

    Returns:
    --------

    """
    This function updates the last element of the angle vector (`theta_array`) to ensure
    the outgoing wave in a multilayer thin-film structure adheres to optical conventions.

    In multilayer thin films, the angles in `theta_array` represent the angles of light with respect
    to the normal in each layer. These angles are influenced by the angle of incidence and the
    wavelength because the refractive index is wavelength-dependent (n(wavelength)).

    The outgoing medium is assumed to have a forward-propagating wave because multilayer thin films
    with complex refractive indices (n + ik) typically don't support negative refractive indices.
    To ensure this optical consistency, the last angle in the `theta_array` (which represents the
    outgoing medium) is updated to its complementary angle. Specifically, the last element is set 
    to `pi - theta_array[-1]`, which effectively adjusts the angle for optical correctness.

    This adjustment is critical for ensuring the outgoing light does not deviate excessively 
    from the normal after passing through a multilayer structure, maintaining a physically and 
    optically consistent representation of the outgoing wave.

    for conditional execution. 

    In contexts where we do not want to alter the `theta_array` during conditional branching, this function serves as an 
    identity function. For example, if light forward propagates in certain scenarios where the outgoing and incoming functions 
    of `theta_array` do not require modification, this function ensures `theta_array` remains unchanged.

def compute_layer_angles(angle_of_incidence: ArrayLike,
                         nk_list: ArrayLike,

    """
    This function calculates the angles of wave propagation within a multilayer system 
    for a given angle of incidence and polarization state. It selects the appropriate 
    function to compute the layer angles based on the type of polarization (s-polarization or p-polarization).
    The function uses `jnp.select` to dynamically choose the appropriate subfunction
    (`compute_layer_angles_s_pol` or `compute_layer_angles_p_pol`) based on the value of the `polarization` array. 
    These subfunctions are responsible for computing the angles for s-polarization or p-polarization, respectively.

    Arguments:
    - angle_of_incidence (ArrayLike): The angle of incidence of the incoming wave, given as a scalar value. 
      This angle is typically measured relative to the normal of the first interface in the multilayer structure.
    - nk_list (ArrayLike): A JAX array containing the complex refractive indices for all layers in the 
      multilayer system. The array structure is as follows:
        [n_incoming, n_layer_0, n_layer_1, ..., n_layer_N, n_outgoing], where:
        - `n_incoming` is the refractive index of the incoming medium,
        - `n_layer_0, n_layer_1, ..., n_layer_N` are the refractive indices of the individual layers, and
        - `n_outgoing` is the refractive index of the outgoing medium.
      The refractive indices can be complex, where the real part represents the refractive index 
      and the imaginary part accounts for material absorption (extinction coefficient).
    - polarization (ArrayLike): A binary JAX array indicating the type of polarization:
        - If the array is [False], it represents s-polarization, where the electric field 
          is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
        - If the array is [True], it represents p-polarization, where the electric field 
          is parallel to the plane of incidence.

    Returns:
    - Array: A JAX array containing the calculated angles of wave propagation within each layer of the multilayer 
      structure. The specific angles depend on the type of polarization and the refractive indices of the layers.
