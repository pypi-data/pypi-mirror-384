    This function generates a list of deposition thicknesses considering a random deviations from the target thicknesses.
    The deviations are applied within a specified percentage range, and the generated thickness samples are meant for 
    sensitivity optimization in multilayer thin film deposition processes. The function introduces a random deviation 
    in both positive and negative directions for each given thickness value and produces multiple samples based on 
    the specified number (sensitivity_analysis_sample_num).

    Arguments:
        - key (jax.Array): The random key to initialize the random number generation.
        - thicknesses (jax.Array):A 1D array of desired target thickness values for each layer in the thin film.
        - sensitivity_analysis_sample_num (jax.Array): The percentage by which the deposition thicknesses can deviate
            from the target (both positive and negative).
        - sensitivity_analysis_sample_num: (int or jax.Array): The number of deposition thickness samples to generate for 
            sensitivity optimization.

    """
    Quantifies the sensitivity of the optical response of a multilayer thin-film stack 
    to random deviations in layer thicknesses using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM).

    This function simulates the impact of thickness variation by introducing stochastic
    perturbations to the nominal thicknesses, then computing the average absolute 
    deviation in reflectance and transmittance across several random samples.

        A list of material names defining the layer sequence from incident medium to substrate.
    
    thickness_list : ArrayLike
        An array specifying the nominal thickness (in nanometers or micrometers) of each layer.

    thickness_deviation_list : ArrayLike
        An array of the same length as `thickness_list`, specifying the standard deviation 
        or maximum deviation allowed for each layerâ€™s thickness during perturbation.

    wavelength_arr : ArrayLike
        A 1D array of wavelengths (in the same unit as used in the optical constants) 
        over which the sensitivity analysis is to be performed.

        A 1D array of incidence angles (in degrees or radians) to be evaluated.

    coherency_list : ArrayLike, optional
        Specifies which layers are optically coherent or incoherent. If None, 
        all layers are assumed to be coherent.

    polarization : Text, optional
        Type of polarization for the incoming wave. Must be 's' for s-polarized 
        or 'p' for p-polarized light. Default is 's'.

    sensitivity_analysis_sample_num : Union[int, ArrayLike], optional
        Number of samples to generate for the thickness deviation analysis. 
        Default is 20.

    seed : int, optional
        Random seed used for reproducibility in sampling thickness perturbations. 
        Default is 1903.
