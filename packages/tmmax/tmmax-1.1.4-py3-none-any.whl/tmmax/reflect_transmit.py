    This function calculates the transmittance (T) for p-polarized light incident on a multilayer slab. 
    Transmittance is a measure of the fraction of incident light energy that passes through a material or structure. 
    In this function, we consider p-polarized light, which means the electric field vector is parallel to the plane of incidence.
    Physically, the transmittance quantifies the portion of light energy that successfully 
    passes through the slab structure, relative to the energy that initially interacted with it. The ratio calculated 
    incorporates the effects of refraction and wave impedance matching between the layers.

    **Arguments:**
    - `t`: A complex array-like object representing the transmission coefficient of p-polarized light. 
      This coefficient is derived from the scattering matrix formalism or similar optical computations and encapsulates
      the interaction of light with the layers of the slab.
    - `nk_first_layer_of_slab`: A complex array-like object representing the refractive index of the first layer of the slab. 
      The refractive index is a fundamental optical property that characterizes how light propagates through the medium.
    - `angle_first_layer_of_slab`: A real array-like object representing the angle of light incidence (or refraction) 
      in the first layer of the slab, in radians.
    - `nk_last_layer_of_slab`: A complex array-like object representing the refractive index of the last layer of the slab.

    - `angle_last_layer_of_slab`: A real array-like object representing the angle of refraction in the last layer of the slab, in radians.

    **Returns:**
    - `T`: A real-valued array representing the transmittance (fraction of energy transmitted through the slab). 
      It is calculated using the ratio of energy flux in the outgoing medium to the energy flux in the incoming medium,

      in the first and last layers.

    This function computes the reflectance (rt) for a multilayer structure. 
    It takes in three arguments:
    
    - nk_list: This is a list (or array) containing the complex refractive index values for the layers in the multilayer stack. 
              The complex refractive index is typically represented as `n + ik`, where `n` is the real refractive index and `k` 
              is the extinction coefficient. The list `nk_list` contains the refractive index values for all N+2 media in the 
              stack structure, including the two outermost media (such as air and substrate).
    
    - angles: This array contains the incident angles (the angle between the normal to the surface and the incoming light) for
              each medium in the multilayer stack. The angles correspond to the light's propagation direction in each layer of 
              the stack.
    
    - polarization: This is a boolean flag (True or False). If `polarization` is False, the function will use the s-polarization (perpendicular polarization) in calculations, 
                    and if `True`, it will use the p-polarization (parallel polarization). This flag determines how the reflectance (rt) is computed 
                    based on the light's polarization state.
    """
    
    # Concatenate the complex refractive indices and angles into a stack (a 2D array).
    # `nk_list` is reshaped to add an extra dimension (axis 1) and then concatenated with `angles`, 
    # creating a 2D stack of both `nk` values (refractive index and extinction coefficient) and angles.
    nk_angles_stack = jnp.concat([jnp.expand_dims(nk_list, 1), jnp.expand_dims(angles, 1)], axis=1)
    
    # Compute the stop value, which is the size of `nk_list` minus 1, to define the last layer in the multilayer stack.
    stop_value = int(jnp.size(nk_list)) - 1
    
    # Generate a 1D array `layer_indices` that contains the indices of the layers, from 0 to `stop_value-1`.
    # This is used for iterating over each layer in the multilayer stack structure.
    layer_indices = jnp.arange(stop_value, dtype=jnp.int32)

    # Call another function `polarization_based_rt_selection` with the `layer_indices`, `nk_angles_stack`, and `polarization`
    # to compute the reflectance (rt). This function likely takes care of the specific calculations based on polarization 
    # and uses the layer information to compute the reflectance at each interface in the stack.
