    """
    This function determines the coherent and incoherent layers in an optical multilayer thin-film stack.
    It analyzes the `coherency_list` to identify consecutive coherent layers and incoherent layers,
    returning structured information about these layers for further processing in optical simulations.

    Arguments:
        coherency_list (ArrayLike): An array of integers (dtype=int32) representing the coherency states of the layers.
                                    The array has N elements for a multilayer stack with N layers, where:
                                    - 0 indicates a coherent layer.
                                    - 1 indicates an incoherent layer.

    Returns:
        1. coherent_groups (Array): A 2D array where each row specifies the start and end indices of consecutive coherent layers.
        2. incoherent_indices (Array): A 1D array containing indices of incoherent layers.

            - Positive indices correspond to incoherent layers.
            - Negative indices correspond to coherent stacks, and their (absolute values - 1) indicate the index of the stack in coherent_groups.

    This function is designed to vectorize the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) calculations

    function to vectorize the `tmm_coh_single_wl_angle_point` function, which performs TMM 
    calculations for a single combination of wavelength and angle of incidence. The first 
    `vmap` maps over the wavelength axis, and the second `vmap` maps over the angle of 
    incidence axis. The other inputs (`data`, `material_distribution`, `thickness_list`, 
    and `polarization`) remain constant during the vectorized computation.

        A 2D array where each row corresponds to the refractive index (n) and extinction 
        coefficient (k) data of a specific material. The first axis length is the number of 
        materials, and the second axis is the length of the nk vs wavelength dataset for

    thickness_list: ArrayLike

    wavelengths: ArrayLike
        The wavelengths of the light wave (in the same units as the nk data). This is used

    angle_of_incidences: ArrayLike
        The angles (in radians) of the incoming light with respect to the normal of the 
        multilayer thin-film surface.

    Arguments:
    ----------
        material_list (List[str]): A list of material names. Each material is identified by a string.
            Example: ["Air", "TiO2", "SiO2"]. These strings specify the materials in the multilayer thin film structure.
            The first and last materials in the list are typically assumed to be semi-infinite layers (e.g., Air, SiO2).
        
        thickness_list (jnp.ndarray): An array of thicknesses corresponding to the thin-film layers.
            Each element specifies the physical thickness of one layer. The order matches the materials in `material_list`.
            The thicknesses should be finite for thin-film layers and can be ignored for the semi-infinite layers.

        wavelength_arr (jnp.ndarray): An array of wavelengths (in micrometers or nanometers) for which the simulation is performed.

        angle_of_incidences (jnp.ndarray): An array of angles of incidence (in degrees) at which the light interacts with the thin film structure.
            Each value represents a different incident angle, and the function calculates results for all specified angles.

        polarization (Text): The type of polarization of light, either "s" (s-polarization) or "p" (p-polarization).
            - "s" refers to perpendicular polarization with respect to the plane of incidence.
