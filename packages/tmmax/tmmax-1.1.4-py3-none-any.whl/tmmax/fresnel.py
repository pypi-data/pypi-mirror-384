    """
    This function calculates the Fresnel reflection (r_s) and transmission (t_s) coefficients
    for s-polarized light (electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence) at the interface
    between two materials. The inputs are the refractive indices and the angles of incidence and
    refraction for the two layers.

    Args:
        first_layer_n (ArrayLike): Refractive index of the first layer (incident medium).
            This can be a single value or an array if computing for multiple incident angles/materials.
        second_layer_n (ArrayLike): Refractive index of the second layer (transmitted medium).
            Similar to the first argument, this can be a single value or an array.
        first_layer_theta (ArrayLike): Angle of incidence in the first layer (in radians).
            This can be a single value or an array.
        second_layer_theta (ArrayLike): Angle of refraction in the second layer (in radians).
            This can be a single value or an array.

    Returns:
        Array: A JAX array containing two elements:
            - r_s: The Fresnel reflection coefficient for s-polarized light.
            - t_s: The Fresnel transmission coefficient for s-polarized light.

    Function Explanation:
    This function implements the Fresnel equations specifically for s-polarized light, where the electric
    field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence. These equations describe how light interacts at the
    boundary between two different optical media. The reflection coefficient, `r_s`, measures the ratio
    of reflected to incident electric field amplitude, while the transmission coefficient, `t_s`, measures
    the ratio of transmitted to incident electric field amplitude. These coefficients depend on the refractive
    indices of the two media and the angles of incidence and refraction. The function returns a single JAX 
    array containing both coefficients, enabling compatibility with differentiable programming and GPU/TPU 
    acceleration.
