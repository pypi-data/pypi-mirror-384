## Introduction

The AWS Generative AI Constructs Library is an open-source extension of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) that provides multi-service, well-architected patterns for quickly defining solutions in code to create predictable and repeatable infrastructure, called [constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html). The goal of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs is to help developers build generative AI solutions using pattern-based definitions for their architecture.

The patterns defined in AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs are high level, multi-service abstractions of AWS CDK constructs that have default configurations based on well-architected best practices. The library is organized into logical modules using object-oriented techniques to create each architectural pattern model.

## CDK Versions

AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs and the AWS CDK are independent teams and have different release schedules. Each release of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs is built against a specific version of the AWS CDK. The [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file lists the CDK version associated with each AWS Generative AI Constructs release. For instance, AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs v0.0.0 was built against AWS CDK v2.96.2. This means that to use AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs v0.0.0, your application must include AWS CDK v2.96.2 or later. You can continue to use the latest AWS CDK versions and upgrade the your AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs version when new releases become available.

## Catalog

The following constructs are available in the library:

### L3 constructs

| **Construct** |Description| AWS Services used |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [SageMaker model deployment (JumpStart)](./src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-model-deployment-sagemaker/README_jumpstart.md) | Deploy a foundation model from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. | Amazon SageMaker |
| [SageMaker model deployment (Hugging Face)](./src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-model-deployment-sagemaker/README_hugging_face.md) | Deploy a foundation model from Hugging Face to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. | Amazon SageMaker |
| [SageMaker model deployment (Custom)](./src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-model-deployment-sagemaker/README_custom_sagemaker_endpoint.md) | Deploy a foundation model from an S3 location to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. | Amazon SageMaker |

| [Bedrock Data Automation](./src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-bedrock-data-automation/README.md) | Use Amazon bedrock data automation client to to build and manage intelligent document processing, media analysis, and other multimodal data-centric automation solutions | AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 bucket |
| [Bedrock Batch Step Functions](./src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-bedrock-batch-stepfn/README.md) | Manage Bedrock model invocation jobs(batch inference) in AWS Step Functions state machines | AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, AWS EventBridge, Amazon Bedrock, AWS IAM |

### L2 Constructs

> [!WARNING]
> Important: Amazon Bedrock L2 constructs are transitioning to the AWS CDK core repository. You can now find these constructs at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-bedrock-alpha.
> Please migrate to the alpha package, as Bedrock L2 constructs in this repository are now deprecated and will no longer receive updates.

| **Construct** |Description| AWS Services used |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| [Amazon Bedrock](./src/cdk-lib/bedrock/README.md) | CDK L2 Constructs for Amazon Bedrock. | Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, AWS Lambda |
| [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless Vector Collection](./src/cdk-lib/opensearchserverless/README.md) | CDK L2 Constructs to create a vector collection. | Amazon OpenSearch Vector Index |

## Sample Use Cases

The official [samples repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-cdk-constructs-samples) includes a collection of functional use case implementations to demonstrate the usage of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs. These can be used in the same way as architectural patterns, and can be conceptualized as an additional "higher-level" abstraction of those patterns. Those patterns (constructs) are composed together into [stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/stacks.html), forming a "CDK app".

## Legal Disclaimer

You should consider doing your own independent assessment before using the content in this library for production purposes. This may include (amongst other things) testing, securing, and optimizing the CDK constructs and other content, provided in this library, based on your specific quality control practices and standards.

        :param directory: -
        :param asset_name: Unique identifier of the docker image asset and its potential revisions. Required if using AppScopedStagingSynthesizer. Default: - no asset name
        :param build_args: Build args to pass to the ``docker build`` command. Since Docker build arguments are resolved before deployment, keys and values cannot refer to unresolved tokens (such as ``lambda.functionArn`` or ``queue.queueUrl``). Default: - no build args are passed
        :param build_secrets: Build secrets. Docker BuildKit must be enabled to use build secrets. Default: - no build secrets
        :param build_ssh: SSH agent socket or keys to pass to the ``docker build`` command. Docker BuildKit must be enabled to use the ssh flag Default: - no --ssh flag
        :param cache_disabled: Disable the cache and pass ``--no-cache`` to the ``docker build`` command. Default: - cache is used
        :param cache_from: Cache from options to pass to the ``docker build`` command. Default: - no cache from options are passed to the build command
        :param cache_to: Cache to options to pass to the ``docker build`` command. Default: - no cache to options are passed to the build command
        :param display_name: A display name for this asset. If supplied, the display name will be used in locations where the asset identifier is printed, like in the CLI progress information. If the same asset is added multiple times, the display name of the first occurrence is used. If ``assetName`` is given, it will also be used as the default ``displayName``. Otherwise, the default is the construct path of the ImageAsset construct, with respect to the enclosing stack. If the asset is produced by a construct helper function (such as ``lambda.Code.fromAssetImage()``), this will look like ``MyFunction/AssetImage``. We use the stack-relative construct path so that in the common case where you have multiple stacks with the same asset, we won't show something like ``/MyBetaStack/MyFunction/Code`` when you are actually deploying to production. Default: - Stack-relative construct path
        :param file: Path to the Dockerfile (relative to the directory). Default: 'Dockerfile'
        :param invalidation: Options to control which parameters are used to invalidate the asset hash. Default: - hash all parameters
        :param network_mode: Networking mode for the RUN commands during build. Support docker API 1.25+. Default: - no networking mode specified (the default networking mode ``NetworkMode.DEFAULT`` will be used)
        :param outputs: Outputs to pass to the ``docker build`` command. Default: - no outputs are passed to the build command (default outputs are used)
        :param platform: Platform to build for. *Requires Docker Buildx*. Default: - no platform specified (the current machine architecture will be used)
        :param target: Docker target to build to. Default: - no target
        :param extra_hash: Extra information to encode into the fingerprint (e.g. build instructions and other inputs). Default: - hash is only based on source content
        :param exclude: File paths matching the patterns will be excluded. See ``ignoreMode`` to set the matching behavior. Has no effect on Assets bundled using the ``bundling`` property. Default: - nothing is excluded
        :param follow_symlinks: A strategy for how to handle symlinks. Default: SymlinkFollowMode.NEVER
        :param ignore_mode: The ignore behavior to use for ``exclude`` patterns. Default: IgnoreMode.GLOB
