This module extends the Loyalty functionality by allowing the definition of a customer
filter for promotion rules. This module is a base to be extended.

It allows to restrict the applicability of a promotion and its rules to a subset of
customers. This is useful when you want to target a specific group of customers with a
promotion. The restriction can be defined at the program level.

When a restriction is defined at the program level, the promotion will only be
available to customers that match the filter.
