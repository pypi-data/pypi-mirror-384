For closing a fiscal year:

1.  Go to *Accounting \> Adviser \> Fiscal year closings*
2.  Click on create.
3.  Select the year for which you want to perform the closing. If your
    fiscal year doesn't coincide with a natural year, input the last
    year of both of the involved years.
4.  Select the closing template you want to use.
5.  Click on "Calculate".
6.  Check the result clicking on the "Show Moves" or "Show Move Lines"
    buttons.
7.  If everything is OK, then click on "Confirm and post moves" for
    finishing the closing, posting and reconciling the journal entries.
8.  You can cancel the closing in any moment pressing "Cancel" button,
    which unreconciles and removes closing journal entries.
9.  If one of the created journal entries is unbalanced, as Odoo doesn't
    allow to create unbalanced entries, a new screen will be shown for
    checking the problem on the created entry.
