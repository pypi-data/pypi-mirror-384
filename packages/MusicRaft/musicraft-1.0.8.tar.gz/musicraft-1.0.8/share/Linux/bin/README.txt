The 'rsvg_convert' program only gets used if musicraft is specifically customized to do so. see 'bin/musciraft_custom.py' and perhaps
'site-packages/musicraft/abcraft/external.py' (class Svg2PDF).

xml2abc.py' is gratefully borrowed from ( Wim Vree. ( see https://wim.vree.org/svgParse/xml2abc.html ). This facilitates  conversion  to abcplus format
from musicxml; this has not yet been integrated into musicraft (e.g. as 'file/import from MusiXML').
