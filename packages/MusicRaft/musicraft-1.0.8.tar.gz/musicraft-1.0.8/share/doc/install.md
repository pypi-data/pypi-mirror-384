____general____


____Windows____

On Windows, you may well need to install python3 yourself;
just browse to <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>
and choose the most recent suitable installer for your platform.

Installation of Musicraft on Microsoft Windows depends
on the presence of the correct version of `msvcp140.dll` in the correct
directory. This is not yet handled automatically.


Musicraft is built for, and must be installed using python 3. Therefore a pre-requisite is that 
python 3 is present on your computer. This will invaraiably
already be the case on Linux systems.

The situation with MAC OSX depends on which release you are using;
this link explains the situation with MAC OSX Catalina:
