  long_description: The AWS Cost Explorer service provides cost information for all
    resources used in your AWS account. The plugin can collect cost billing data from
    all accounts linked to AWS Organization. Because the Cost Explorer API provided
    by AWS is used, additional fees may be incurred for API calls.
