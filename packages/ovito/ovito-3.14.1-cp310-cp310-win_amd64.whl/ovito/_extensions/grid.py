    """
    Returns a dictionary view providing key-based access to all :py:class:`VoxelGrids <VoxelGrid>` in
    this data collection. Each :py:class:`VoxelGrid` has a unique :py:attr:`~ovito.data.DataObject.identifier` key,
    which allows you to look it up in this dictionary. To find out which voxel grids exist in the data collection and what
    their identifiers are, use

    .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/data_collection_grids.py
        :lines: 7-7

    Then retrieve the desired :py:class:`VoxelGrid` from the collection using its identifier key, e.g.

    .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/data_collection_grids.py
        :lines: 12-13

    The view provides the convenience method :py:meth:`!grids.create`, which
    inserts a newly created :py:class:`VoxelGrid` into the data collection. The method expects the unique :py:attr:`~ovito.data.DataObject.identifier`
    of the new grid as first argument. All other keyword arguments are forwarded to the constructor
    to initialize the member fields of the :py:class:`VoxelGrid` class:

    .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/data_collection_grids.py
        :lines: 19-23

    If there is already an existing grid with the same :py:attr:`~ovito.data.DataObject.identifier` in the collection, the :py:meth:`!create`
    method modifies and returns that existing grid instead of creating another one.

    """
    Returns a shaped view of the given grid property, which reflects the 2- or 3-dimensional :py:attr:`shape` of the grid.

    :param key: The name of the grid property to look up. May include the underscore suffix to make the property mutable. Alternatively, you can directly specify a :py:class:`Property` object from this :py:class:`VoxelGrid`.
    :returns: A `NumPy view <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.copies.html>`__ of the underlying property array.

    Because the :py:class:`VoxelGrid` class internally uses linear :py:class:`Property` arrays to store the voxel cell values,
    you normally would have to convert back and forth between the linear index space of the underlying property storage and
    the 2- or 3-dimensional grid space to access individual voxel cells.

    The :py:meth:`view` helper method frees you from having to map grid coordinates to array indices because it gives you a shaped NumPy view
    of the underlying linear storage, which reflects the correct multi-dimensional shape of the grid. For 3-dimensional grids, the ordering of the
    view's dimensions is :math:`x,y,z[,k]`, with :math:`k` being an extra dimension that is only present if the accessed property
    is a vector field quantity. For 2-dimensional grids, the ordering of the view's dimensions is :math:`x,y[,k]`.

    The returned view lets you conveniently access the values of individual grid cells based on multi-dimensional grid coordinates.
    Here, as an example, the scalar field property ``c_ave`` of a 3-dimensional voxel grid:
