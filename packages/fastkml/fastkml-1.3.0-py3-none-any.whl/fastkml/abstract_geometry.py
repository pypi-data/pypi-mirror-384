Classes and functions for working with geometries in KML files.

The classes in this module represent different types of geometries, such as points,
lines, polygons, and multi-geometries.
These geometries can be used to define the shape and location of features in KML files.

The module also provides functions for handling coordinates and extracting them from XML
elements.
