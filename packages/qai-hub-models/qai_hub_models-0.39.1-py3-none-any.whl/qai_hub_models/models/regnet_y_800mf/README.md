# [RegNet-Y-800MF: Lightweight convolutional neural network for image classification](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/regnet_y_800mf)

RegNet_Y_800MF is part of the RegNet family of models designed for efficient and scalable image classification. It uses a simple yet effective design space to balance performance and computational cost, making it suitable for mobile and edge devices.

This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/regnet_y_800mf).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.




## Example & Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install qai-hub-models
```


Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo on the host machine:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.regnet_y_800mf.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This package contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.regnet_y_800mf.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
