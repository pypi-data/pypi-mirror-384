# [Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R: Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R is a hybrid model offering versatile functionality, handling both complex reasoning tasks and general text generation, with mode selection managed through the tokenizer's chat template](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r)

SEA-LION is a collection of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have been pretrained and instruct-tuned for the Southeast Asia (SEA) region. The model is quantized to w4a16 (4-bit weights and 16-bit activations) and part of the model is quantized to w8a16 (8-bit weights and 16-bit activations) making it suitable for on-device deployment. For Prompt and output length specified below, the time to first token is Llama-PromptProcessor-Quantized's latency and average time per addition token is Llama-TokenGenerator-Quantized's latency.

This is based on the implementation of Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R found [here](https://github.com/aisingapore/sealion/blob/main/models/sea-lion-v3.5/llama-sea-lion-v3.5-8B.md). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on QualcommÂ® devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r).

## Deploying Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R on-device

Please follow the [LLM on-device deployment](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial.



## Example & Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai-hub-models[llama-v3-1-sea-lion-3-5-8b-r]"
```

For llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r, some additional functionality can be faster or is availiable
only with a GPU on the host machine.

- ðŸŸ¢ Exporting the model for on-device deployment (GPU not required)
- ðŸŸ¡ Running the demo (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- ðŸŸ¡ Running evaluation (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- ðŸ”´ Quantizing the model (GPU required)

If you are quantizing your own variant of llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r, a dedicated CUDA enabled
GPU (40 GB VRAM for 3B models to 80 GB VRAM for 8B models) is recommended. A GPU
can also increase the speed of evaluation and demo of your quantized model
significantly but it not strictly required.

Install the GPU package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai-hub-models[llama-v3-1-sea-lion-3-5-8b-r]" onnxruntime-gpu==1.22 https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases/download/2.14.0/aimet_onnx-2.14.0+cu121-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```



Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo on the host machine:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This package contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.llama_v3_1_sea_lion_3_5_8b_r.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
