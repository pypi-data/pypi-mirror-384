# MQT QuSAT - A Tool for Utilizing SAT in Quantum Computing

MQT QuSAT is a tool for utilizing satisfiablity testing (SAT) techniques in quantum computing.
It is part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

## Key Features

- Encode Clifford circuits in SAT
- Check the equivalence of Clifford circuits using SAT

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
Among others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

## Getting Started

`mqt.qusat` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qusat/).

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.qusat
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qusat).**

## System Requirements

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.24 or newer.
For details on how to build the project, please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qusat).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT QuSAT is compatible with all [officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

The SMT Solver [Z3 >= 4.8.3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) has to be installed and the dynamic linker has to be able to find the library.
This can be accomplished in a multitude of ways:

- Under Ubuntu 20.04 or newer: `sudo apt-get install libz3-dev`
- Under macOS: `brew install z3`
- Alternatively: `pip install z3-solver` and then append the corresponding path to the library path (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` under Linux, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` under macOS), e.g., via
  ```bash
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(python -c "import z3; print(z3.__path__[0]+'/lib')")
  ```
- Download pre-built binaries from https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases and copy the files to the respective system directories
- Build Z3 from source and install it to the system
