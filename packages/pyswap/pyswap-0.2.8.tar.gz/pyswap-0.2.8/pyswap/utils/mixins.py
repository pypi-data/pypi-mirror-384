# mypy: disable-error-code="attr-defined, no-any-return, index"
# attr-defined error showed in when the .update method was called in the wofost mixin.
# the easiest way to fix it would be to just check for the PySWAPBaseModel
# instance, but that would create circular import issue and I did not want to
# play with that. It's not a priority to fix for now.
# no-any-return error was raised in the get_origin method. This was not a
# priority to fix. Same as the index error; it complained that the FieldInfo
# object is not indexable, but in fact in this case it should be, because of the
# Optional or Annotated types.

"""Reusable mixins enhancing functionality of specific PySWAPBaseModel.

To keep the main PySWAPBaseModel class and the components library clean and
focused, mixins are used to add additional functionality to the classes that
need it. The concept of the mixins was inspired by the Django framework and it
really helps to keep the code clean and organized.

Should more functionality be needed in the future for one or more classes, it
should be implemented as a mixin and then inherited by the classes that need it.

Classes:

    FileMixin: Custom saving functionality for models that need file I/O.
    SerializableMixin: Converting a model to a SWAP-formatted string.
    YAMLValidatorMixin: Validating parameters using external YAML rules.
    WOFOSTUpdateMixin: Interface for the WOFOST crop parameters database for
        pySWAP.
