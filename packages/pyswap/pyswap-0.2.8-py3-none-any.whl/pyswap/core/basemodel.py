# mypy: disable-error-code="attr-defined"
# attr-defined is disabled because it was easier to implement part of the

# fixed later.
"""Base models inherited by all pySWAP models.

A lot of functionality can be abstracted away in the base models. This way, the
code is more DRY and easier to maintain. The base models are used to enforce
the correct data types and structure of the input data. They also provide
methods to convert the data to the format required by the SWAP model.

Classes defined here are based on Pydantic BaseModel and Pandera DataFrameModel.
Both are meant to ensure the correct data types and structure of the input data,
as successful validation means smooth execution of the SWAP model. Particularily
important when run as a submitted job on an HPC.

Classes:
    BaseModel: Base class for pySWAP models. Inherits from Pydantic BaseModel.
    BaseTableModel: Base class for pySWAP models that validate pandas
        DataFrames. Inherits from Pandera DataFrameModel.
