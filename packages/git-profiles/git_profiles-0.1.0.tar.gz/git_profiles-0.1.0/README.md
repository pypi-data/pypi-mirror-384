A **CLI tool to manage multiple Git configuration profiles**, allowing developers to switch between
different identities and settings quickly. Profiles are stored persistently and can be applied to
local Git repositories with ease.

---

## Features

- Create, update, and delete Git config profiles.
- Set and unset key-value pairs in profiles (`user.name`, `user.email`, etc.).
- Apply a profile to the local Git repository.
- Duplicate existing profiles.
- List all available profiles and show profile contents.
- Cross-platform persistent storage using `platformdirs`.
- Input validation for safe keys and valid emails.
- Quiet mode for scripting or automation.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install git-profiles
```

### Install via Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install nkaaf/tap/git-profiles
```

### Development Installation

Clone the repository and install in editable mode using `uv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nkaaf/git-profiles.git
cd git-profiles

# Ensure dependencies are exactly in sync with the lockfile
uv sync
```

> This allows you to modify the source code while testing. Make sure uv is installed on your system;
> it is used to manage dependencies and run project commands.

---

## Usage

After installation (via PyPI, Homebrew, or the development workflow), you can use `git-profiles` in
**three ways**:

1. **Global CLI (recommended fallback):**

```bash
git-profiles <command>
```

2. **Git alias (preferred and automatically available if Git is installed):**

```bash
git profiles <command>
```

> üí° **Tip:** The Git alias integrates seamlessly with your workflow and is the most convenient way
> to run commands.

3. **Python module (for development or scripting):**

```bash
python3 -m git_profiles <command>
```

> üí° Examples below will show both the **global CLI** and **Git alias** variants.

---

### Set a key-value pair in a profile

```bash
git-profiles set work user.name "Alice Example"
git-profiles set work user.email "alice@example.com"

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles set work user.name "Alice Example"
git profiles set work user.email "alice@example.com"
```

### Remove a key from a profile

```bash
git-profiles unset work user.email

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles unset work user.email
```

### Apply a profile to the local Git repository

```bash
git-profiles apply work

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles apply work
```

This sets all the keys in the `work` profile for the current repository.

### List all available profiles

```bash
git-profiles list

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles list
```

### Show all key-values of a profile

```bash
git-profiles show work

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles show work
```

### Remove an entire profile

```bash
git-profiles remove work

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles remove work
```

### Duplicate a profile

```bash
git-profiles duplicate work personal

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles duplicate work personal
```

Creates a copy of the `work` profile named `personal`.

---

### Options

* `-q`, `--quiet`: Suppress normal output. Errors are still shown.

```bash
git-profiles -q apply work

# Git alias equivalent:
git profiles -q apply work
```

---

## Development

> üí° **Prerequisite:** Make sure you have **uv installed** on your system. It is the dependency
> manager used to install dev dependencies, manage Python interpreters, and run project commands.

Get your development environment ready in a few steps:

```bash
# 1. Install all development dependencies (pytest, tox, ruff, pre-commit, etc.)
uv sync

# 2. Install pre-commit git hooks
pre-commit install
```

> üí° After this, your environment is ready to run tests, linting, and builds.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Always run commands via `uv run poe <script>` (e.g., `uv run poe lint`,
`uv run poe test`).
> This ensures the correct uv-managed environment is used. Running `poe` or `tox` directly may fail
> if the environment isn‚Äôt active, especially on CI runners.

---

### Linting

```bash
# Run all linting checks
uv run poe lint
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This internally runs `pre-commit` using the uv-managed environment.
> üí° Commits automatically trigger pre-commit hooks after `pre-commit install`.
> If any hook fails (e.g., lint errors), the commit is blocked until fixed.

---

### Testing

```bash
# Run all test environments defined in pyproject.toml
uv run poe test
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This internally runs `tox` using the uv-managed environment.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Tox requires the Python interpreters listed in `[tool.tox].envlist`.
> With the `tox-uv` plugin, missing interpreters are installed automatically.
> You can also install specific Python versions manually with `uv python install <version>`.

---

### Building

You can build the `git-profiles` package locally for testing or distribution:

```bash
# Ensure your development environment is synced
uv sync

# Build both wheel and source distribution
uv build
```

> ‚ö° Using `uv sync` ensures that all development dependencies are available during the build
> process.

## CI / GitHub Actions

The repository‚Äôs CI pipelines automatically run:

* Tests across all Python versions defined in `[tool.tox].envlist`
* Pre-commit hooks for linting and code quality

> ‚úÖ This ensures that every commit and pull request is tested and checked consistently with your
> local development setup.
