        This utility is used to create a 3D segmentation mask by projecting the 
        center z-slice of the 3D objects to their own z-boundaries.<br><br>
        
        For example, an object with three segmented z-slices will become 
        a "cylindrical" object,<br>
        where the largest z-slice is projected up and down to the max and 
        min z-slice.

        This utility is used to <b>load the information of an external 
        tracker</b> into Cell-ACDC.<br><br>
        
        It creates a new (or overwrites existing) segmentation file where 
        the <b>IDs of the segmented objects are taken from a table</b> in 
        CSV format.<br><br>
        
        This table is a typical output of trackers. It <b>must contain a column 
        with the frame index</b> (starting from 0), a column with the<br>
        <b>tracked IDs</b> of the segmented objects</b>, plus either a column 
        with the corresponding IDs in the segmentation mask or the <br>
        two columns with the <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates of the objects' 
        centroids.<br><br>
        
        The <b>name of the columnns is not relevant</b>, you will be asked to 
        choose which column is what.<br><br>
        
        Note that to use this utility you <b>need to have a Cell-ACDC 
        compatible segmentation file</b>.
