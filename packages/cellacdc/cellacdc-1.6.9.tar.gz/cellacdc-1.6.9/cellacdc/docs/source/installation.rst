Installation
============

Here you will find a detailed guide on how to install Cell-ACDC. We now provide
an installer exe for windows, which takes care of downloading Cell-ACDC and 
setting it up. For this, please see section :ref:`install-windows`.
In all other cases, please see :ref:`python-environment-guide` for information
on Python and how to use it.
In general, you should be fine with installing the stable version, 
however, Cell-ACDC development is still quite rapid and if you want to 
try out the latest features we recommend installing the latest version. On the 
other hand, installing from source is required only if you plan to contribute 
to Cell-ACDC development. In that case see this 
section :ref:`contributing-guide`.

   </a>

The installer eliminates the need to use the terminal and provides a streamlined
installation process for Windows users. It automatically sets up a Conda environment
and installs all necessary dependencies, including the GUI libraries.

It ships with `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`__ as a package manager 
and `Portable Git <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`__ for version control.

Please find more information on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC_installer>`__.

**The installation steps are as follows:**

1. Download the installer from the `link above <https://hmgubox2.helmholtz-muenchen.de/index.php/s/aBFkjEYrH6HW5bN>`__.

2. Run the installer by double-clicking on it. Accept the prompt to allow the installer to make changes to your computer.

3. The installer will now open. Navigate the pages using the "Next" and "Back" buttons.

4. Choose the installation directory. We recommend leaving it as default, and not installing it in a directory which might need administrator rights to write to.

5. Choose the Cell-ACDC source. The installer offers four options:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 30 70
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Option
        - Description
      * - **Install Cell-ACDC from GitHub**
        - Downloads the latest version directly from the official GitHub repository. This ensures you get the most up-to-date version with all the latest features and bug fixes. Uses either git from path or the portable git included with the installer.
      * - **Install embedded Cell-ACDC**
        - Uses a pre-packaged version of Cell-ACDC that is included with the installer. This option works without an internet connection and guarantees a tested, stable version.
      * - **Use custom Cell-ACDC repository path**
        - Allows you to specify a local path to a Cell-ACDC repository on your computer. This is useful if you have a custom or modified version of Cell-ACDC, or if you want to use a specific version that you have already downloaded.
      * - **Specific PyPI version**
        - Deselect all other options to use the drop-down menu to select one of the available versions on PyPI. This will install a non-editable version of Cell-ACDC.

   We recommend using **"Install Cell-ACDC from GitHub"** for most users to ensure you get the latest version.

6. Click "Next" to continue with the installation. Check the box if you want to use your own conda or python instead of the one provided by the installer.

7. Continue with the installation by clicking "Next", and choose the name of the start menu folder where Cell-ACDC will be installed. You can leave the default name or choose a custom one.

8. Finally, use the checkbox to decide if a desktop shortcut should be created. If you want to create a desktop shortcut, check the box and click "Next".

9. Review the installation details and start the installation process by clicking "Install".

10. The required packaged files will be unpacked.

11. After unpacking, a terminal window will open which will install and set up Cell-ACDC. Please monitor it for updates on progress and for potential errors.

12. Once the installation is complete, you will see a message indicating that Cell-ACDC has been successfully installed. You can now launch Cell-ACDC from the start menu or desktop shortcut.

.. note:: 

    * If you encounter any issues during the installation, please refer to the `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC_installer/issues>`__.
    * The installer was created using `Inno Setup <https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>`__.
    * If there was an error during installation, the Cell-ACDC-installer exe can be found in the installation directory and can be run again.


.. _python-environment-guide:

Python environment guide
------------------------

All other installation methods require you to have at least basic knowledge of
Python and the command line.
    
If you are **new to Python** or you need a **refresher** on how to manage 
scientific Python environments, I highly recommend reading 
`this guide <python-guide>`__ by Dr. Robert Haase.


.. _install-stable-version:

Install stable version
----------------------

1. Install `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install>`_ 
    Conda is the standard **package manager** for Python in the scientific 
    community.

2. Open a **terminal**
    Roughly speaking, a terminal is a **text-based way to run instructions**. 
    On Windows, use the **Anaconda prompt**, you can find it by searching for it. 
    On macOS or Linux you can use the default Terminal app.

3. **Update conda** by running the following command:
    
    .. code-block:: 
    
        conda update conda
    
    This will update all packages that are part of conda.

4. **Create a virtual environment** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        conda create -n acdc python=3.10

    This will create a virtual environment, which is an **isolated folder** 
    where the required libraries will be installed. 
    The virtual environment is called ``acdc`` in this case.

5. **Activate the virtual environment** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        conda activate acdc
    
    This will activate the environment and the terminal will know where to 
    install packages. 
    If the activation of the environment was successful, this should be 
    indicated to the left of the active path (you should see ``(acdc)`` 
    before the path).

    .. important:: 

       Before moving to the next steps make sure that you always activate 
       the ``acdc`` environment. If you close the terminal and reopen it, 
       always run the command ``conda activate acdc`` before installing any 
       package. To know whether the right environment is active, the line 
       on the terminal where you type commands should start with the text 
       ``(acdc)``, like in this screenshot:

       .. tabs::

            .. tab:: Windows

                .. figure:: images/conda_activate_acdc_windows.png
                    :width: 100%

                    Anaconda Prompt after activating the ``acdc`` environment 
                    with the command ``conda activate acdc``.
            
            .. tab:: macOS

                .. figure:: images/conda_activate_acdc_macOS.png

                    Terminal app after activating the ``acdc`` environment 
                    with the command ``conda activate acdc``.


6. **Update pip** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    
    While we could use conda to install packages, Cell-ACDC is not available 
    on conda yet, hence we will use ``pip``. 
    Pip the default package manager for Python. Here we are updating pip itself.

7.  **Install Cell-ACDC** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
        
        pip install "cellacdc"
        
    This tells pip to install Cell-ACDC.

8. **Install the GUI libraries**:

    After successful installation, you should be able to **run Cell-ACDC with 
    the command** ``acdc``. Remember to **always activate** the ``acdc`` 
    environment with the command ``conda activate acdc`` every time you 
    open a new terminal before starting Cell-ACDC.
    
    The first time you run Cell-ACDC you will be guided through the automatic 
    installation of the GUI libraries. Simply answer ``y`` in the terminal when 
    asked. 

    At the end you might have to re-start Cell-ACDC.

Updating to the latest stable version of Cell-ACDC 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update to the latest version of Cell-ACDC , open the terminal, activate the 
``acdc`` environment with the command ``conda activate acdc`` and the run the 
following command::
        
    pip install --upgrade cellacdc

    .. code-block:: 
   
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    
    While we could use conda to install packages, Cell-ACDC is not available 
    on conda yet, hence we will use ``pip``. 
    Pip the default package manager for Python. Here we are updating pip itself.

7.  **Install Cell-ACDC** directly from the GitHub repo with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
        
        pip install "git+https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC.git"
    
    .. tip:: 

        If you **already have the stable version** and you want to upgrade to the 
        latest version run the following command instead:

        .. code-block::

            pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC.git"

    This tells pip to install Cell-ACDC.

    .. important::
    
        On Windows, if you get the error ``ERROR: Cannot find the command 'git'`` 
        you need to install ``git`` first. Close the terminal and install it 
        from `here <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_. After installation, 
        you can restart from here, but **remember to activate the** ``acdc`` 
        **environment first** with the command ``conda activate acdc``.

8. **Install the GUI libraries**:

    After successful installation, you should be able to **run Cell-ACDC with

.. _install-from-source-developer-version:

Install from source (developer version)
---------------------------------------

If you want to try out experimental features (and, if you have time, maybe report a bug or two :D), you can install the developer version from source as follows:

1. Install `Miniconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/success>`_ or `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install>`_ 
    Conda is the standard **package manager** for Python in the scientific

    On Windows, use the **Anaconda prompt**, you can find it by searching for it. 
    On macOS or Linux you can use the default Terminal.

3. **Clone the source code** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
    
        git clone https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC.git

    .. important::
    
        On Windows, if you get the error ``ERROR: Cannot find the command 'git'`` 
        you need to install ``git`` first. Close the terminal and install it 
        from `here <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_. After installation, 
        you can restart from here, but **remember to activate the** ``acdc`` 
        **environment first** with the command ``conda activate acdc``.

4. **Navigate to the Cell_ACDC folder** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        cd Cell_ACDC

    The command ``cd`` stands for "change directory" and it allows you to move 
    between directories in the terminal. 

5. **Update conda** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 

        conda update conda
    
    This will update all packages that are part of conda.

    on conda yet, hence we will use ``pip``. 
    Pip the default package manager for Python. Here we are updating pip itself.

9.  **Install Cell-ACDC** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        pip install -e "."

    The ``.`` at the end of the command means that you want to install from 
    the current folder in the terminal. This must be the ``Cell_ACDC`` folder 
    that you cloned before. 

10. **Install the GUI libraries**:

    After successful installation, you should be able to **run Cell-ACDC with 
    the command** ``acdc``. Remember to **always activate** the ``acdc`` 
    environment with the command ``conda activate acdc`` every time you

    asked. 

    At the end you might have to re-start Cell-ACDC. 

    .. include:: _gui_packages.rst


Updating Cell-ACDC installed from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update Cell-ACDC installed from source, open a terminal window, navigate to the 
Cell-ACDC folder with the command ``cd Cell_ACDC`` and run ``git pull``.

Since you installed with the ``-e`` flag, pulling with ``git`` is enough.
