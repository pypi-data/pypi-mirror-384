            Example1_s01_acdc_output.csv

      - Main table containing cell cycle annotations and additional metrics such as mean, median etc. for all the loaded channels plus all the region properties (as calculated by `skimage.measure.regionprops <https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.regionprops>`__) for each segmented object.

      - **Last visited frame** in “Segmentation and Tracking mode” with the main GUI.
    * - .. code-block::

            Example1_s01_metadata.csv

      - Table containing the **metadata** such as number of frames, number of z-slices, pixel size etc.
