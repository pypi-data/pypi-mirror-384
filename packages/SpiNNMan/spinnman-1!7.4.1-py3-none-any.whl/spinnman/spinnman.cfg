ignore_bad_ethernets = True
@ignore_bad_ethernets = When True if any non ethernet chip claims it has a IP address this is logged and ignored
    When False the whole chip is removed
report_waiting_logs = False
@report_waiting_logs = Debugging option. If True adds logging while the host waits on cores to be in a particular state.
turn_off_machine = False
@turn_off_machine = Adds an optional step to the end of the simulation to turn of [physically connected boards](machine_name).
spalloc_machine = None
@spalloc_machine = Name of the Spalloc Machine to be used.
   Optional unless the [URL](spalloc_server) points to multiple spalloc machines.
spalloc_use_proxy = True
@spalloc_use_proxy = Indicates that the spalloc proxy server is needed.
   Needed to access spalloc from a different network.
   Jupiter notebook users should leave this as set by the server admin.
bmp_names = None
@bmp_names = Only needed for [physical board(s)](machine_name) with both am Ethernet and BMP cable connected.

   format is:
   *  bmp_names     = <host>[/(<board-range>|board_id[,board_id]*)
   *  <board_range> = <board_id>-<board_id>

   where:
   * <host> is the hostname or IP address of the BMP
   * <board_range> is a range of boards that the BMP can speak to
   * <board_id> is the ID of a single board in a frame

   Note this no longer supports multiple host nor cabinet or frame

auto_detect_bmp = False
@auto_detect_bmp = Only needed for [physical board(s)](machine_name) with both am Ethernet and BMP cable connected.
   If True the assumption is the BMP IP addresss is one less than the [Ethernet](machine_name)
reset_machine_on_startup = False
@reset_machine_on_startup =
  Will power cycle the boards at startup.
  Not needed normally.

spalloc_group = None
@spalloc_group = The group to allocate the [spalloc](spalloc_server) usage too.
   Ignored if the environment variable NMPI_JOB_ID (and optionaly) NMPI_USER are set.
   Also ignored if the current director points to a collab.

spalloc_retry = 3
@spalloc_retry = Maximum number of times to retry getting spalloc jobs on board boor errors

spalloc_height = None
@spalloc_height = Testing Option. Height in triads when using new spalloc.
  Must be used in connection with spalloc_width.

  Warning. If set (or defaulted) boards/chip required will be ignored

  Warning. If set spalloc_triad, spalloc_physical or spalloc_ip_address
     will point to the board with the 0,0 Chip.
     So must point to lower left board of a triad.
spalloc_width = None
@spalloc_width = Testing Option. Width in triads when using new spalloc.
  Ignored if spalloc_height is None.

spalloc_triad = None
@spalloc_triad = Testing Option.
  X, Y, Z of the logical coordinate of the board to request.
  A single string of three comma seperated ints

  Warning. If set boards/chip required will be ignored.
    spalloc_height and spalloc_width can be used.

  Warning. This option will cause the spalloc to error if the traid is not available
spalloc_physical = None
@spalloc_physical = Testing Option.
  Cabinet, Frame, Board the physical coordinate of the board to request.
  A single string of three comma seperated ints
  Ignored if spalloc_triad is not None

  Warning. If set boards/chip required will be ignored.
    spalloc_height and spalloc_width can be used.

  Warning. This option will cause the spalloc to error if physical is not available
spalloc_ip_address = None
@spalloc_ip_address = Testing Option.
  IP address of the base baord for a spalloc job
  Ignored if spalloc_triad or spalloc_physical are not None

  Warning. If set boards/chip required will be ignored.
    spalloc_height and spalloc_width can be used.

  Warning. This option will cause the spalloc to error if IP Address is not available

spalloc_max_dead_boards = None
@spalloc_max_dead_boards = Testing Option.
   The number of dead boards that can be in the requested area.

   If not set when spalloc_height is set the server will default to 0

   Warning. Not recommended when spalloc_height is not set as it may allow
   spalloc to return a job/Machine with less than the requested boards reachable.
