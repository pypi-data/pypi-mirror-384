# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-14

### Changed

- All adapters refactored to align with new error handling standards

### Fixed

- `WeaviateAdapter.from_obj` missing vector field in query results
- `AsyncWeaviateAdapter` async context manager mocking in tests
- `PostgresModelAdapter` IPv4Address/IPv6Address type conversion for classmethod usage
- Migrated to Pydantic v2 `ConfigDict` (eliminated 12 deprecation warnings)
- pytest_asyncio fixture compatibility (eliminated 15 warnings)

### Improved

- Test coverage: `async_mongo_` 76%→95%, `async_weaviate_` 37%→78%, `weaviate_` 67%→79%
- Added 40+ comprehensive async_mongo_ tests covering error paths
- Overall project coverage improved to 83%

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- AsyncRedisAdapter with comprehensive Redis support (msgpack/JSON
  serialization, TTL, NX/XX operations)
- Pattern-based retrieval for Redis keys
- Production-ready test coverage with testcontainers

### Fixed

- Python 3.10 compatibility for TypedDict imports (NotRequired, Required)
- Python 3.10 isinstance() syntax compatibility
- AsyncNeo4jAdapter context manager and query result processing
- Test isolation - unit tests no longer require Docker
- 97+ linting issues auto-fixed

### Changed

- CI/CD improvements with dynamic coverage thresholds
- Better error reporting in test pipeline

## 0.2.3 - 2025-05-29

### Added

- **Field Families and Common Patterns Library** (Issue #114): Introduced a
  comprehensive field system with:
  - `FieldTemplate`: Reusable field definitions with flexible naming
  - `FieldFamilies`: Core database pattern collections (ENTITY, SOFT_DELETE,
    AUDIT)
  - `DomainModelBuilder`: Fluent API for building models with method chaining
  - `ProtocolFieldFamilies`: Field sets that ensure protocol compliance
  - `ValidationPatterns`: Common regex patterns and constraint builders
  - `create_protocol_model()`: Function to create protocol-compliant models
    (structure only)
- **Protocol Enhancements**:
  - Added protocol constants (`IDENTIFIABLE`, `TEMPORAL`, etc.) for type-safe
    protocol selection
  - Added `create_protocol_model_class()`: Factory function that creates models
    with both structural fields AND behavioral methods in one step
  - Added `combine_with_mixins()`: Helper to easily add protocol behaviors to
    existing models

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Removed "event" from the protocol system in
  `ProtocolFieldFamilies`. The `Event` class remains available but is no longer
  part of the protocol selection system since it's a concrete class, not a
  protocol interface.

### Fixed

- Fixed import organization issues (E402 errors)
- Updated tests to reflect simplified field families
- Fixed email validation test expectations
- Updated documentation to align with new architecture
- Fixed SQLAlchemy primary key mapping issue in
  test_model_adapter_enhancements.py

## 0.2.0 - 2025-05-24

### Highlights

This release introduces two major foundational modules: **Fields** and
**Protocols**. These modules provide a robust and extensible framework for
defining data structures and behaviors within `pydapter`.

- **Fields Module (`pydapter.fields`)**: A powerful system for defining typed,
  validated, and serializable fields. It includes pre-defined field types for
  common use cases like IDs, datetimes, embeddings, and execution tracking,
  along with a flexible `Field` class for custom definitions and a
  `create_model` utility for dynamic Pydantic model creation.
- **Protocols Module (`pydapter.protocols`)**: A set of composable interfaces
  (e.g., `Identifiable`, `Temporal`, `Embeddable`, `Invokable`,
  `Cryptographical`) that define standard behaviors for Pydantic models. The
  `Event` protocol combines these to offer comprehensive event tracking
  capabilities, enhanced by the `@as_event` decorator for easily instrumenting
  functions.

These additions significantly enhance `pydapter`'s ability to model complex data
interactions and workflows in a standardized and maintainable way.

### Added

- **New `pydapter.fields` module**: Introduced a robust system for defining
  typed, validated, and serializable fields (e.g., IDs, datetimes, embeddings,
  execution tracking) and a `create_model` utility for dynamic Pydantic model
  creation. (Related to Issue #100, PR #99)
- **New `pydapter.protocols` module**: Added composable protocol interfaces
  (`Identifiable`, `Temporal`, `Embeddable`, `Invokable`, `Cryptographical`) and
  an `Event` protocol with an `@as_event` decorator for comprehensive event
  modeling and function instrumentation. (Related to Issue #100, PR #99)
- **Hybrid Documentation System**: Implemented a new documentation system
  combining auto-generated API skeletons with rich manual content and automated
  validation (markdown linting, link checking). (Issue #103, PR #104)
- Updated CI to install documentation validation tools. (Issue #105)

### Fixed

- Resolved Python 3.10 compatibility issues related to `datetime.timezone.utc`.
  (Part of PR #99 fixes)
- Addressed various `mkdocs` build warnings and broken links in the
  documentation. (Part of PR #104 fixes)

  - `AsyncWeaviateAdapter` - Asynchronous adapter for Weaviate vector database
    using aiohttp for REST API calls
