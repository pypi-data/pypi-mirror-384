- üìö **Multi-notebook support:** Seamlessly switch between multiple notebooks.
- ü§ù **MCP-compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

Compatible with any Jupyter deployment (local, JupyterHub, ...) and with [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai/) hosted Notebooks.

## üîß Tools Overview

The server provides a rich set of tools for interacting with Jupyter notebooks, categorized as follows:

### Server Management

| Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `list_files` | Recursively list files and directories in the Jupyter server's file system. |
| `list_kernels` | List all available and running kernel sessions on the Jupyter server. |
| `assign_kernel_to_notebook` | Create a Jupyter session to connect a notebook file to a specific kernel. |

### Multi-Notebook Management

| Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `use_notebook` | Connect to a notebook file, create a new one, or switch between notebooks. |
| `list_notebooks` | List all notebooks available on the Jupyter server and their status  |
| `restart_notebook` | Restart the kernel for a specific managed notebook. |
| `unuse_notebook` | Disconnect from a specific notebook and release its resources. |

### Cell Operations and Execution

| Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `list_cells` | List basic information for all cells to provide a quick overview of notebook |
| `read_cell` | Read the full content (source and outputs) of a single cell. |
| `read_cells` | Read the full content of all cells in the notebook. |
| `insert_cell` | Insert a new code or markdown cell at a specified position. |
| `delete_cell` | Delete a cell at a specified index. |
| `overwrite_cell_source` | Overwrite the source code of an existing cell. |
| `execute_cell` | Execute a cell with timeout, it supports multimodal output including images. |
| `insert_execute_code_cell` | A convenient tool to insert a new code cell and execute it in one step. |
| `execute_ipython` | Execute IPython code directly in the kernel, including magic and shell commands. |

For more details on each tool, their parameters, and return values, please refer to the [official Tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/tools).

## üèÅ Getting Started

For comprehensive setup instructions‚Äîincluding `Streamable HTTP` transport, running as a Jupyter Server extension and advanced configuration‚Äîcheck out [our documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/). Or, get started quickly with `JupyterLab` and `STDIO` transport here below.

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

### 2. Start JupyterLab

```bash
# Start JupyterLab on port 8888, allowing access from any IP and setting a token
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running notebooks through JupyterHub instead of JupyterLab as above, you should:
>
> - Set the environment variable `JUPYTERHUB_ALLOW_TOKEN_IN_URL=1` in the single-user environment.
> - Ensure your API token (`MY_TOKEN`) is created with `access:servers` scope in the Hub.

### 3. Configure Your Preferred MCP Client

Next, configure your MCP client to connect to the server. We offer two primary methods‚Äîchoose the one that best fits your needs:

- **üì¶ Using `uvx` (Recommended for Quick Start):** A lightweight and fast method using `uv`. Ideal for local development and first-time users.
- **üê≥ Using `Docker` (Recommended for Production):** A containerized approach that ensures a consistent and isolated environment, perfect for production or complex setups.

<details>
<summary><b>üì¶ Using uvx (Quick Start)</b></summary>

First, install `uv`:
```bash
pip install uv
uv --version
# should be 0.6.14 or higher
```
See more details on [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then, configure your client:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jupyter-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "DOCUMENT_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "DOCUMENT_ID": "notebook.ipynb",
        "RUNTIME_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üê≥ Using Docker (Production)</b></summary>

**On macOS and Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_URL",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_TOKEN",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_ID",
        "-e", "RUNTIME_URL",
        "-e", "RUNTIME_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DOCUMENT_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "DOCUMENT_ID": "notebook.ipynb",
        "RUNTIME_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**On Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_URL",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_TOKEN",
        "-e", "DOCUMENT_ID",
        "-e", "RUNTIME_URL",
        "-e", "RUNTIME_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DOCUMENT_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "DOCUMENT_ID": "notebook.ipynb",
        "RUNTIME_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Ensure the `port` of the `DOCUMENT_URL` and `RUNTIME_URL` match those used in the `jupyter lab` command.
> 2. In a basic setup, `DOCUMENT_URL` and `RUNTIME_URL` are the same. `DOCUMENT_TOKEN`, and `RUNTIME_TOKEN` are also the same and is actually the Jupyter Token.
> 3. The `DOCUMENT_ID` parameter specifies the path to the notebook you want to connect to. It should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started.
>    - **Optional:** If you omit `DOCUMENT_ID`, the MCP client can automatically list all available notebooks on the Jupyter server, allowing you to select one interactively via your prompts.
>    - **Flexible:** Even if you set `DOCUMENT_ID`, the MCP client can still browse, list, switch to, or even create new notebooks at any time.

For detailed instructions on configuring various MCP clients‚Äîincluding [Claude Desktop](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/claude_desktop), [VS Code](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/vscode), [Cursor](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/cursor), [Cline](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/cline), and [Windsurf](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients/windsurf) ‚Äî see the [Clients documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/clients).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Interact with LLMs that supports multimodal input (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to fully utilize advanced multimodal understanding capabilities.
- Use a MCP client that supports returning image data and can parse it (like Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.), as some clients may not support this feature.
- Break down complex task (like the whole data science workflow) into multiple sub-tasks (like data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, etc.) and execute them step-by-step.
