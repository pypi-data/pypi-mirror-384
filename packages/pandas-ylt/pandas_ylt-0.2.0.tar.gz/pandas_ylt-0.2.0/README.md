pandas-ylt
==========

Python modules for working in pandas with various loss data tables used for CAT modelling


## Installation

I use a virtual environment. You can see requirements in the file `requirements.txt`

You can install locally with

```
python setup.py install
```

## Modules
Best in python if you do
```
import pandas_ylt
help(pandas_ylt)
```
Then help on each module.
