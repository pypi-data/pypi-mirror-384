class Tree(Copyable):
    """
    __init__(root)
    
    A :class:`Tree` represents a rooted tree
    (e.g. alignment guide tree or phylogenetic tree).

    The tree itself wraps a *root* :class:`TreeNode` object,
    accessible via the :attr:`root` property.

    A :class:`Tree` is not a container itself:
    Objects, e.g species names or sequences, that are represented by the
    nodes, cannot be stored directly in a :class:`Tree` or its nodes.
    Instead, each leaf :class:`TreeNode` has a reference index:
    These indices refer to a separate list or array, containing the
    actual reference objects.

    The property :attr:`leaves` contains a list of the leaf nodes,
    where the index of the leaf node in this list is equal to the
    reference index of the leaf node (``leaf.index``).

    The amount of leaves in a tree can be determined via the
    :func:`len()` function.

    Objects of this class are immutable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    root: TreeNode
        The root of the tree.
        The constructor calls the node's :func:`as_root()` method,
        in order to make it immutable.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    root : TreeNode
        The root node of the tree.
    leaves : list of TreeNode
        The leaf nodes of the tree.
        The index of the leaf node in this list is equal to the
        reference index of the leaf node.
        This attribute is a shallow copy of the repsective internal
        object.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> objects = ["An object", "Another object", "Yet another one"]
    >>> leaf1 = TreeNode(index=0)
    >>> leaf2 = TreeNode(index=1)
    >>> leaf3 = TreeNode(index=2)
    >>> inter = TreeNode([leaf1, leaf2], [5.0, 7.0])
    >>> root  = TreeNode([inter, leaf3], [3.0, 10.0])
    >>> tree  = Tree(root)
    >>> print(tree)
    ((0:5.0,1:7.0):3.0,2:10.0):0.0;
    >>> print([objects[node.index] for node in tree.leaves])

        bond_set : DiGraph
            A *NetworkX* directed graph.
            For a leaf node the graph node is its reference index.
            For an intermediate and root node the graph node is a tuple

    """
    __init__(children=None, distances=None, index=None)
    
    :class:`TreeNode` objects are part of a rooted tree
    (e.g. alignment guide tree).
    There are two :class:`TreeNode` subtypes:
        
        - Leaf node - Cannot have child nodes but has an index referring
          to an array-like reference object.
        - Intermediate node - Has child nodes but no reference index
    
    This subtype is determined based on whether child nodes were given
    to the constructor.
    
    Every :class:`TreeNode` has a reference to its parent node.
    A root node is node without a parent node, that is finalized
    using `as_root()`.
    The call of this function prevents that a the node can be used as
    child.

    :class:`TreeNode` objects are semi-immutable:
    The child nodes or the reference index are fixed at the time of
    creation.
    Only the parent can be set once, when the parent node is created. 
    :class:`TreeNode` objects that are finalized using `as_root()` are
    completely immutable.

    All object properties are read-only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    children: array-like object of TreeNode, length=n, optional
        The children of this node.
        As this causes the creation of an intermediate node,
        this parameter cannot be used in combination with `index`.
    distances: array-like object of float, length=n, optional
        The distances of the child nodes to this node.
        Must be set if `children` is set.
    index: int, optional
        Index to a reference array-like object
        (e.g. list of sequences or labels).
        Must be a positive integer.
        As this causes the creation of a leaf node, this parameter
        cannot be used in combination with the other parameters.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    parent : TreeNode
        The parent node.
        `None` if node has no parent.
    children : tuple of TreeNode
        The child nodes.
        `None` if node is a leaf node.
    index : int
        The index to a reference array-like object.
        `None` if node is not a leaf node.
    distance : float
        Distance to parent node.
        `None` if `parent` is `Ç¸one`.

def as_binary(tree_or_node):

    as_binary(tree_or_node)

    Convert a tree into a binary tree.

    In general a :class:`TreeNode` can have more or less than two
    children.
    However guide trees usually expect each intermediate node to have
    exactly two child nodes.
    This function creates a binary :class:`Tree` (or :class:`TreeNode`)
    for the given :class:`Tree` (or :class:`TreeNode`):
    Intermediate nodes that have only a single child are deleted and its
    parent node is directly connected to its child node.
    Intermediate nodes that have more than two childs are divided into
    multiple nodes (distances are preserved).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    tree_or_node : Tree or TreeNode
        The tree or node to be converted into a binary tree or node.
    
    Returns
    -------
    binary_tree_or_node : Tree or TreeNode
        The converted tree or node.
