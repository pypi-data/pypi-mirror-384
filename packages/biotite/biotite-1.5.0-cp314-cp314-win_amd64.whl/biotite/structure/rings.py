    """
    The type of pi-stacking interaction.

def find_aromatic_rings(atoms):
    """
    Find (anti-)aromatic rings in a structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : AtomArray or AtomArrayStack
        The atoms to be searched for aromatic rings.
        Requires an associated :class:`BondList`.

    Returns
    -------
    rings : list of ndarray
        The indices of the atoms that form aromatic rings.
        Each ring is represented by a list of indices.
        Only rings with minimum size are returned, i.e. two connected rings
        (e.g. in tryptophan) are reported as separate rings.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not distinguish between aromatic and antiaromatic rings.
    All cycles containing atoms that are completely connected by aromatic bonds
    are considered aromatic rings.

    The PDB *Chemical Component Dictionary* (CCD) does not identify aromatic rings in
    all compounds as such.
    Prominent examples are the nucleobases, where the 6-membered rings are not
    flagged as aromatic.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> nad = residue("NAD")
    >>> rings = find_aromatic_rings(nad)
    >>> print(rings)
    [array([41, 37, 36, 35, 43, 42]), array([19, 18, 16, 15, 21, 20]), array([12, 13, 14, 15, 21])]
    >>> for atom_indices in rings:

    Find pi-stacking interactions between aromatic rings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : AtomArray
        The atoms to be searched for aromatic rings.
        Requires an associated :class:`BondList`.
    centroid_cutoff : float
        The cutoff distance for ring centroids.
    plane_angle_tol : float
        The tolerance for the angle between ring planes that must be either
        parallel or perpendicular.
        Given in radians.
    shift_angle_tol : float
        The tolerance for the angle between the ring plane normals and the
        centroid difference vector.
        Given in radians.

    Returns
    -------
    interactions : list of tuple(ndarray, ndarray, PiStacking)
        The stacking interactions between aromatic rings.
        Each element in the list represents one stacking interaction.
        The first two elements of each tuple represent atom indices of the stacked
        rings.
        The third element of each tuple is the type of stacking interaction.

    find_aromatic_rings : Used for finding the aromatic rings in this function.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not distinguish between aromatic and antiaromatic rings.
    Furthermore, it does not distinguish between repulsive and attractive stacking:
    Usually, stacking two rings directly above each other is repulsive, as the pi
    orbitals above the rings repel each other, so a slight horizontal shift is
    usually required to make the interaction attractive.
    However, in details this is strongly dependent on heteroatoms and the exact
    orientation of the rings.
    Hence, this function aggregates all stacking interactions to simplify the
    conditions for pi-stacking.

    The conditions for pi-stacking are :footcite:`Wojcikowski2015` :

        - The ring centroids must be within cutoff `centroid_cutoff` distance.
          While :footcite:`Wojcikowski2015` uses a cutoff of 5.0 Å, 6.5 Å was
          adopted from :footcite:`Bouysset2021` to better identify perpendicular
          stacking interactions.
        - The planes must be parallel or perpendicular to each other within a default
          tolerance of 30°.
        - The angle between the plane normals and the centroid difference vector must be
          be either 0° or 90° within a default tolerance of 30°, to check for lateral
          shifts.

    angle_tol : float, optional
        The tolerance for the angle between the ring plane normal

        has 0° angle (perpendicular to ring plane).
        Given in radians.

    Returns
    -------
    interactions : list of tuple(ndarray, int)
        The pi-cation interactions between aromatic rings and cations.
        Each element in the list represents one pi-cation interaction.

        aromatic ring, the second element is the atom index of the cation.

    Notes
    -----
    The conditions for pi-cation interactions are:

        - The angle between the ring plane normal and the centroid-cation
          vector must be within `angle_tol` of 0° (perpendicular to plane).
