def find_overlaps(contigs, min_overlap):
    """
    Find overlaps between pairs of contigs based on specified minimum overlap.

    This function takes a list of contigs and identifies overlapping
    regions between pairs of contigs where the overlap is at least `min_overlap`
    nucleotides. For each pair of contigs that overlap, it records the contigs and
    the length of the overlap.

    Parameters:
    - contigs (list of str): A list of contig sequences (strings) to check for overlaps.
    - min_overlap (int): The minimum number of nucleotides that must overlap between two contigs.

    Returns:
    - overlaps (list of tuples): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
        - contig1 (str): The first contig in the overlapping pair.
        - contig2 (str): The second contig in the overlapping pair.
        - overlap_length (int): The length of the overlap between the two contigs.

    Example:
    ```
    contigs = ["ATCG", "CGTA", "GTAC", "TACG"]
    min_overlap = 2
    overlaps = find_overlaps(contigs, min_overlap)
    # Output: [('ATCG', 'CGTA', 2), ('CGTA', 'TACG', 3), ('GTAC', 'TACG', 3)]
