Python package to locate landmarks from edge profiles.

Supports:

- Pseudo-landmark sampling.
- Mathematical landmark detection.
- Plateau fitting.

## Usage

HeavyEdge-Landmarks provides functions to locate landmarks from multiple profiles.

A simple use case to locate 10 pseudo-landmarks:

```python
from heavyedge import get_sample_path, ProfileData
from heavyedge_landmarks import pseudo_landmarks
with ProfileData(get_sample_path("Prep-Type2.h5")) as data:
    x = data.x()
    Ys, Ls, _ = data[:]
lm = pseudo_landmarks(x, Ys, Ls, 10)
```

Refer to the package documentation for more information.

## Documentation
