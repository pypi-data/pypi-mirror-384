# mcp-server-svn

An **MCP server integration for SVN**. This project exposes core Subversion (SVN) version control operations as MCP tools, enabling seamless automation and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework.

## Features

- Status, diff, log, update, add, commit, and checkout for SVN repositories
- Branching operations: list, create, and delete branches/tags
- Integration via the [fastmcp](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/fastmcp) library as a first-class MCP server
- Easily connects SVN workflows to automated agent ecosystems

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- [fastmcp](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/fastmcp)
- Subversion (SVN) command-line client should be installed and available in PATH.

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
# or with poetry:
# poetry install
```

## Usage

Start the server (available after install via entry point):

```bash
mcp-server-svn
```

The server will launch and register the following MCP tools:
- `svn_status`
- `svn_diff`
- `svn_commit`
- `svn_update`
- `svn_log`
- `svn_add`
- `svn_checkout`
- `svn_switch`
- `svn_list_branches`
- `svn_create_branch`
- `svn_delete_branch`

Each tool corresponds to the documented Python wrapper in `mcp_server_svn/tools/`.

You can also run directly via Python:

```bash
python -m mcp_server_svn
```

## Example: Checking repo status

You can call the `svn_status` tool through MCP/fastmcp-compatible agents or directly in Python:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
server = FastMCP("svn")
result = server.call("svn_status", {"repo_path": "/path/to/your/repo"})
print(result)
```

## Development

- All code is PEP8-compliant and type-hinted.
- Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue for bugs/feature requests.
