class FineAmplitudeCalibration(Experiment):
    """
    Parameters for running a fine amplitude calibration experiment for
    a specified gate on a transmon.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to target.
    gate : Literal["sx", "x"]
        The gate to be calibrated.
    repetitions : list[int], optional
        List of repetition counts for the calibration experiment.
        Defaults to every fourth number from 0 to 100.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 10,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 1,000.
    measure_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use for the measurement pulse.
        Defaults to the measurement defcal.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
