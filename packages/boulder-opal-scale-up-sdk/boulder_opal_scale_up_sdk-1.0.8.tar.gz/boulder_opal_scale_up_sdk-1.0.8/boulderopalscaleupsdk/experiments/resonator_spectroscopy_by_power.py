    Parameters for running a resonator spectroscopy by power experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    resonator : str
        The reference for the resonator to target.
    frequencies : list[int] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable or CWSIterable \
                  or HypIterable or None, optional
        The frequencies at which to scan, in Hz.
        Defaults to a scan around the readout frequency.
    powers_dbm : list[float] or None, optional
        The powers at which to scan the readout pulse, in dBm.
        If None, a default power scan will be used.
    duration_ns : int, optional
        The duration of the readout pulse, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 2,000 ns.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 1,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 100.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
