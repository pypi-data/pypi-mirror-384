    Parameters for running an experiment to find the dispersive shift for a transmon
    resonator pair.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to target.
    frequencies : list[int] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable or CWSIterable \
                  or HypIterable or None, optional
        The frequencies at which to scan, in Hz.
        Defaults to a scan around the readout frequency.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 200,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 100.
    measure_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use for the measurement pulse.
        Defaults to the measurement defcal.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
