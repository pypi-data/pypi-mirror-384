    Parameters for running a Power Rabi EF experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to target.
    scales : list[float] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable \
            or CWSIterable or HypIterable or None, optional
        The scaling factors for the drive pulse amplitude.
        If None, a default scan will be used.
    drive_waveform : Waveform
        The waveform to use for the drive pulse.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 200,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 400.
    pulse_vp : float, optional
        The voltage per pulse, in volts. Defaults to the amplitude of the X gate.
    measure_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use for the measurement pulse.
        Defaults to the measurement defcal.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
