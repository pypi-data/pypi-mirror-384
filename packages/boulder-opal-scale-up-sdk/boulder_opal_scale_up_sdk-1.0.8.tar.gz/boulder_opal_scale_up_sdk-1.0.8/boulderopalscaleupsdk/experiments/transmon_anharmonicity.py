class TransmonAnharmonicity(Experiment):
    """
    Parameters for running a transmon anharmonicity experiment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transmon : str
        The reference for the transmon to target.
    frequencies : list[int] or LinspaceIterable or RangeIterable or CWSIterable \
                  or HypIterable or None, optional
        The frequencies at which to scan, in Hz.
        Defaults to a scan based on the transmon's frequency and anharmonicity.
    anharmonicity : float, optional
        The guessed anharmonicity of the transmon, in Hz.
        Used to determine the scan frequencies if not provided. Defaults to -200 MHz.
    recycle_delay_ns : int, optional
        The delay between consecutive shots, in nanoseconds. Defaults to 10,000 ns.
    shot_count : int, optional
        The number of shots to take. Defaults to 400.
    spectroscopy_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use in the spectroscopy pulse.
        Defaults to a constant waveform with a duration of 2,000 ns
        and an amplitude of 1.5 times the transmon's x_vp.
    measure_waveform : ConstantWaveform or None, optional
        The waveform to use for the measurement pulse.
        Defaults to the measurement defcal.
    run_mixer_calibration: bool, optional
        Whether to run mixer calibrations before running a program. Defaults to False.
    update : "auto" or "off" or "prompt", optional
        How the device should be updated after an experiment run. Defaults to auto.
