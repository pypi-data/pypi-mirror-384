          "The practice of Indian classical dance, like meditation, tames and purifies the external Sthula-Sharira (the body composed of fluid, with humours and saps, as also of the bones, muscles and vital vulnerable junctures) as it quiets and balances the body’s three humours (tridosha, tridhaatu) – wind (vata), phlegm (kapha) and fire (pitta). Eventually the dancer should begin to discover the Suksma Sharira (the subtle, metaphysical interior body) within her which articulates the psycho-spiritual experiences similar to those of the yogi and the pilgrim or devotee visiting the temple. This subtle body, most often identified with Kundalini Yoga, is defined by one of the many scholars as “ an invisible mandala formed by a combination of symbolic (but also very real) geometric figures” and often depicted as a microcosm of the universe, with the Shiva Samhita noting, “All the beings that exist in the three worlds are also to be found in the subtle body”. Rightly, it is called the seat of the Atma or soul.  And the discovery of this subtle body is made possible by the awakening of the vital Kundalini energy within the dancer’s body through the practise and performance of the Odissi repertoire wherein the dancer begins with Mangalacharan, an invocation at the entrance to the temple, proceeds to circumambulate the temple structure depicting the exquisite physical beauty of the numerous postures in various bhangi-s sculpted on the temple walls through Batu, then advancing through the Natya Mandapa with the joyous Pallavi, enters the Garbha griha with the self-reflective Abhinaya, an Ashatapadi wherein she is in private conversation with her Lord, finally leading to Moshya Nata, the dance of liberation. Thus, the repertoire leads the dancer from collective external consciousness to singular internal consciousness such that in Mokshya Nata a moment of absolute peace and stillness is reached when the dancer is in total union while in movement with her Atma or soul within.
