system_prompt: You are an expert in extracting slide schemas for slides. Your task is to analyze slide HTML and create a JSON schema that captures the slide elements and their relationships. Your output should be a dictionary in JSON format, where each key-value pair strictly corresponds to the text content in a `<p>` element or the `alt` attribute of an `<img>` element.
template: |
  Please analyze the slide elements and create a structured slide schema in JSON format. You should:

  1. Understand the html representation of the slide, especially the style, layout, and the logical relationship between elements

  2. For each element, extract the following information:
    - "name": The role and feature of the element, such as "section/main/sub title", "left/right bullets", "portrait/landscape/square image", "presenters", "dates", "bolded paragraph", "slide/section number", "header", "footer", "quote", "caption", "table", "chart description", etc. Be descriptive and specific about the element's purpose and position on the slide.
    > Note: The slide number typically appears with small font size at the footer or header of the slide and corresponds to the slide's position in the presentation sequence. The section number typically appears with large font size at the top or center of the slide.
     - "type": Literal["text", "image"]
    - "data": List[str]
        * For text elements: The content of each paragraph, defined as text within `<p>` tags, must be treated as a single, distinct item.
          - Preserve newlines (`\n`) within paragraphs, ensuring they remain intact and are not split into multiple items. Only `<p>` tags serve as separators.
          - Do not combine multiple `<p>` tags into a single item, regardless of logical or narrative connections. Each `<p>` tag represents a separate item.
        * For image elements: Use the `alt` attribute of the <img> tag as the data of the image

  3. Do not include any empty elements, only given elements should be included
  Example Input:
  <div style="font-size: 32pt; top: 50pt; left: 100pt; width: 500pt; height: 80pt; font-weight: bold;">
    <p>text0</p>
  </div>
  <div style="font-size: 14pt; top: 150pt; left: 100pt; width: 300pt; height: 200pt;">
    <p>text1\ntext2\ntext3</p>
  </div>
    <div style="font-size: 14pt; top: 150pt; left: 600pt; width: 300pt; height: 200pt;">
    <p>text1\ntext2\ntext3</p>
  </div>
  <img alt="caption of image" src="pic.png" style="top: 150pt; left: 450pt; width: 400pt; height: 300pt;">

  Example Output:
  {
      "elements": [
          {
              "name": "main title",
              "type": "text",
              "data": ["text0"]
          },
          {
              "name": "left bullets",
              "type": "text",
              "data": ["text1\ntext2\ntext3"]
          },
          {
              "name": "right bullets",
              "type": "text",
              "data": ["text1\ntext2\ntext3"]
          },
          {
              "name": "main image",
              "type": "image",
              "data": ["caption of image"]
          }
      ]
  }


  Input:
  This is the {{slide_idx}} slide of the presentation:
  {{slide}}

  Output: Please provide the slide schema in a dict of JSON format

  - slide
  - slide_idx
