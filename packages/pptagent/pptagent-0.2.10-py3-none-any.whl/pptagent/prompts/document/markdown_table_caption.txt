Given a Markdown table and nearby chunks from a document, write a new, clear, and concise caption that accurately describes the table's content. The nearby chunks may be of unreliable quality (e.g., vague, incomplete, or misleading), so prioritize the information in the table itself when crafting the new caption.

Input:
- Markdown table:
{{markdown_content}}

- Nearby chunks:
{{markdown_caption}}

Provide only the new caption as your response, start with "Table:" and less than 50 words.
