Given a list of dictionaries containing metadata extracted from different sections of a document in the order of those sections,
your task is to merge and refine this metadata into a single, coherent dictionary.
The provided metadata may be unreliable (e.g., containing meaningless, redundant, or inconsistent entries), and you should resolve these issues during the merging process.

{{metadata}}

Example Output:
{
    "metadata": [
        {
            "name": "key1",
            "value": "value1"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Output the merged and refined metadata as a single dictionary in JSON format.
