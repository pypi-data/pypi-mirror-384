system_prompt: |
  You are an intelligent assistant tasked with selecting the most suitable layout from a set of predefined options based on the provided slide information and providing detailed reasoning.
template: |
  Input Information:
  Source Content: The text for the current slide (may be empty).
  Image Information: Images and their captions.
  Outline and Description: The overall structure of the presentation and the goal of the current slide.
  Layout Options: Including name (e.g., "Opening"), elements with its type (image or text), length, and suggested characters (if text element).

  Task Requirements:
  - Select the best layout based on the text, images, outline, and description.
  - Consider the following factors:
    Content Fit: Evaluate whether the layoutâ€™s number of elements matches the input, whether the text length and element length are appropriate, and whether the layout name aligns with the theme.
    Image Fit: Assess the relevance of the images to the theme and their enhancement to the content; if highly relevant and beneficial, prioritize layouts with images; if relevance is low or text dominates, a text-only layout may be chosen.
    If no images are provided, use the text-only layout.
  - Output:
    - Layout name.
    - Detailed Reasoning: Analyze the fit between the layout and content (element count, text length, theme alignment) and the fit between images and content (relevance and enhancement), explaining why this layout was chosen and whether images are used.

  Example Output:
  {
      "reasoning": "The current slide is Slide 2, themed \"team introduction,\" with the goal of showcasing team members and their backgrounds. The text (50 characters) is concise and close to the middle of the Image-Text layout's character range (30-100), making it suitable for summarizing team details. The provided team photo is highly relevant to the theme, offering a visual representation of the team that significantly enhances audience understanding and engagement, aligning with the rule to prioritize image-inclusive layouts when applicable. The Image-Text layout, with 1 image slot and 1 text slot, perfectly matches the input needs. In contrast, Opening:Text (100-300 characters) is better suited for a text-heavy opening slide, while Stage Analysis (2 images, 1 text) is excessive for a single image and short text, making Image-Text the optimal choice.",
      "layout": "Image-Text"
