    "# Analyzing Breast Tissue (Normal vs. Cancer) Hi-C Data with `jointly-hic`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `jointly-hic` toolkit to jointly embed Hi-C contact matrices derived from breast tissue samples, as published in *Choppavarapu et al.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technique that quantifies 3D chromatin contacts by generating matrices of contact frequencies between genomic bins. By embedding these matrices into a low-dimensional space, we can compare chromatin architecture across different conditions and cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we:\n",
    "- Map Hi-C data from 12 breast tissue samples from *Choppavarapu et al.* using [`distiller-nf`](https://github.com/open2c/distiller-nf).\n",
    "- Prepare the mapped data for embedding and analysis using `jointly-hic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hi-C Data Source and Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw and processed Hi-C data for the breast tissue samples were originally published by *Choppavarapu et al.* and are available through the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number [**GSE261230**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE261230).\n",
    "\n",
    "To map the raw Hi-C data, we used the **SRA Run (SRR) identifiers** provided in the GEO entry to download the original FASTQ files. These were then processed using the `distiller-nf` pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pipeline is set up, each sample can be mapped by referencing its corresponding SRR ID within the `project.yml` configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you will need the following Python packages and command-line tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Packages\n",
    "- `jointly-hic`: For joint embedding and analysis of Hi-C data.\n",
    "- `cooler`: For handling `.cool` and `.mcool` Hi-C files.\n",
    "- `cooltools`: Additional utilities for Hi-C file operations and balancing.\n",
    "- `pandas`, `numpy`, and other common dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install them using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jointly-hic cooler cooltools pandas numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command-Line Tools: `distiller-nf`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `distiller-nf` tool is a modular Hi-C mapping pipeline. To set up a new project, execute the following command in your project folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nextflow clone open2c/distiller-nf ./\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, follow the instructions here: [distiller-nf GitHub](https://github.com/open2c/distiller-nf).  \n",
    "The folder for this demo also includes the `project.yml` file, which can be used with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nextflow run distiller.nf -params-file project.yml\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Joint Embedding of Breast Tissue Hi-C Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "We have obtained `.mcool` files for 12 breast tissue samples. The next step is to jointly embed these contact matrices into a low-dimensional vector space using the `jointly-hic` tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `jointly embed` command performs out-of-core matrix decomposition using PCA (default), NMF, or SVD. It stacks contact matrices from all samples at a specified resolution and learns a shared representation that preserves biological variation across samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Hi-C data are generated from human samples, we will set the resolution to **50kb**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of this Embedding:\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction** and visualization\n",
    "- **Clustering** and trajectory inference\n",
    "- **Integration** with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, or ChIP-seq via **JointDb**\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this example, we will run `jointly embed` with the following parameters:\n",
    "- **Input**: All `.mcool` files located in the `./data/` directory\n",
    "- **Resolution**: 50kb\n",
    "- **Assembly**: `hg38`\n",
    "- **Method**: PCA\n",
    "- **Components**: 32\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these are clinical samples from female donors, we will exclude **chrY** and **chrM** during the embedding process to reduce noise and improve the quality of the output.\n"
