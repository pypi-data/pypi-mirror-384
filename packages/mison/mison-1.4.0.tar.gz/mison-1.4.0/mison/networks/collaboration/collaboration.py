    Construct a `DevCollaboration` network from a `DevFileMapping` or `DevComponentMapping` graph.

    This function builds a `DevCollaboration` network by analyzing how many files or components
    a pair of developers have both modified. The number of shared files/components determines the
    edge weight between developers, following the approach described in [1].

    ### Graph Structure:
    - **Nodes**: Developers.
    - **Edges**: A weighted edge exists between two developers if they have both modified at least one
      common file (in `DevFileMapping`) or component (in `DevComponentMapping`).
    - **Edge Weights**: The weight of an edge represents the number of shared files or components
      modified by both developers.

    """
    Construct a `DevCollaboration` network using cosine similarity of log-normalized developer activity vectors.

    This function generates a `DevCollaboration` graph from a `DevFileMapping` or `DevComponentMapping`
    graph by computing the similarity between developers based on the files or components they have modified.
    The weight of an edge between two developers is given by the **cosine similarity** of their activity vectors,
    where each vector entry represents the **log-normalized** count of commits to a particular file or component,
    following the approach described in [1].

    ### Graph Structure:
    - **Nodes**: Developers.
    - **Edges**: A weighted edge exists between two developers if their activity vectors (i.e., the files
      or components they have modified) have a nonzero cosine similarity.
    - **Edge Weights**: The weight of an edge between developers `u` and `v` is computed as:

      \[
      w(u, v) = \frac{\mathbf{w}_u \cdot \mathbf{w}_v}{\|\mathbf{w}_u\| \|\mathbf{w}_v\|}
      \]

      where:
      - \(\mathbf{w}_u\) and \(\mathbf{w}_v\) are the **log-normalized** activity vectors of developers `u` and `v`.
      - Each entry in the vector represents the **log-transformed commit count** of a developer to a specific file or component:

        \[
        w_{u, f} = \text{commits}(u, f) \times \log\left(\frac{N_{\text{files}}}{\text{degree}(f)}\right)
        \]

        where:
        - \(\text{commits}(u, f)\) is the number of commits made by developer `u` to file `f`.
        - \(N_{\text{files}}\) is the total number of files in the dataset.
        - \(\text{degree}(f)\) is the number of developers who have modified file `f`.

      - Higher similarity values indicate stronger collaboration between developers.
