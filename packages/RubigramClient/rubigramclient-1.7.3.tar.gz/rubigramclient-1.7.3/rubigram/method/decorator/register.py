        This method is used internally by decorators such as
        `on_message`, `on_inline`, and similar ones to attach a function
        as an event handler. It wraps the given function inside a `Handler`
        object and stores it in the appropriate handler list.

        Args:
            self (rubigram.Client): The active Rubigram client instance.
            handlers (List[Handler]): The list where the handler should be registered.
            filters (Optional[Filter], optional): A filter or filter group to
                restrict which updates trigger the handler. Defaults to None.
            group (int, optional): The handler's execution priority.
                Lower values are executed first. Defaults to 0.

        Returns:
            Callable: A decorator that registers the provided function as a handler.

        Example:
            >>> @app.on_message(filters.text)
            >>> async def handle_text(client, update):
            >>>     await client.send_message(update.chat_id, "Received text!")
