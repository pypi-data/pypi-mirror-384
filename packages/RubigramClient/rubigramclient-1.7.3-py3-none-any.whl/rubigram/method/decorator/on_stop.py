        This decorator registers a function that will be called when the
        client stops. It is typically used for cleaning up resources,
        saving data, or closing database connections before shutdown.

        Args:
            self (rubigram.Client): The active Rubigram client instance.
            func (Callable[[rubigram.Client], None]): The async function to be executed on shutdown.

        Returns:
            Callable: The function itself, after being registered.
