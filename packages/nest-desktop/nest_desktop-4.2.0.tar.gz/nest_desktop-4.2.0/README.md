### Synopsis

NEST Desktop is a web-based application which provides a graphical user interface for [NEST
Simulator](https://nest-simulator.org). With this easy-to-use tool, users can interactively construct neuronal networks
and explore network dynamics.

Advanced users often choose NEST Simulator: a prominent tool for spiking neuronal networks to measure network
dynamics.However, programming knowledge is required to write code for this tool. NEST Desktop bypasses this requirement,
but still teaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks. A textual script is generated from the
constructed networks and sent to NEST Simulator; the network activity is then visualized in a graph or table. It is a
useful teaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported to files that users
can implement for their course protocol.

NEST Desktop is available on [EBRAINS](https://ebrains.eu/service/nest-desktop) (free EBRAINS account required).

### Quick start

To get started with NEST Desktop and NEST Simulator, use Docker compose with the configuration file:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up --build
```

For more information, please see the [User Documentation Page](https://nest-desktop.readthedocs.io).
