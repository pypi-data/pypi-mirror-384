"""
Log into Nextstrain.org (and other remotes) and save credentials for later use.

The first time you log in to a remote you'll be prompted to authenticate via
your web browser or, if you provide a username (e.g. with --username), for your
Nextstrain.org password.  After that, locally-saved authentication tokens will
be used and automatically renewed as needed when you run other `nextstrain`
commands requiring log in.  You can also re-run this `nextstrain login` command
to force renewal if you want.  You'll only be prompted to reauthenticate (via
your web browser or username/password) if the locally-saved tokens are unable
to be renewed or missing entirely.

If you log out of Nextstrain.org (or other remotes) on other devices/clients
(like your web browser), you may be prompted to reauthenticate by this command
sooner than usual.

Your username and password themselves are never saved locally.
