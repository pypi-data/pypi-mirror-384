  261    loop(tt(t), put tt.tl t.tl .. );
  262 Minimizing/Maximizing does not apply to this model type

  274 Inconsistent values for display specification
  274 Required format is :-

  274    -or-    1..(dimension-rows)  number of labels each column
  275 This set is used already as an indexing map and can only be used
  275   as a reference. No additional indexing is possible.
  275   For example, x(link(i,j),link(ii,jj)) = .... is incorrect

  319 Set must be defined to be used as a domain
  320 An aliased set cannot be redeclared
  321 A '(' following an 'IF' is missing. We assumed you wanted to write
  321 an if-statement. This statement has been introduced with GAMS 2.25
  321 and it is possible that 'if' was used as an identifier.
  321 The GAMS parameter G205=1 can be used to run with the old syntax.
  322 Wrong complementarity pair. Has to be equ.var.
  323 Priorities can only be used on discrete variables
  324 Scales cannot be applied to discrete variables

  336 This version of GAMS does not allow the declaration of
  336    variables and equations. It is intended to run precompiled

  336    your distributor or GAMS Development Corporation.
  337 A set has been domain-checked by itself but has more than
  337    one dimension.   SET I(I) / a,b,c /;
  338 Unique element expected - symbol was not an element
  338    and the following text will be skipped until a proper
  338    symbol is found to recover. Remember that an UNQUOTED
  338    element has to start with a letter or digit
  338    followed by letters, digits, '+', '-' or '_'. The length
  338    is limited to 63 characters. The following words are
  338    reserved (starting symbols of a GAMS statement) and cannot
  338    be used for UNQUOTED set elements:

  338       TABLE, VARIABLE(S), WHILE
  338
  338    QUOTED elements can contain any character. Single and
  338    double quotes can be used (starting and ending quote have
  338    to match).
  339 Option PROFILE=n cannot be used inside a loop.
  340 A label/element with the same name exist. You may have forgotten
  340    to quote a label/element reference. For example,
  340    set i / a,b,c /; parameter x(i); x('a') = 10;
  341 Symbol/ident missing in $IF [NOT] DECLARE/DEFINED statement
  341    Line has been ignored

  439 FOR index variable has to be a scalar
