Pip distributions:

To perform a pip distribution, follow the steps listed below:

1. Define DEME version in setup.py's setup function
2. Download python build with the following command: python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
3. Make sure you conda install cmake.
4. Run the following command in the DEM-Engine directory: python -m build .
5. Download Twine in order to upload packages to pyPi: python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
6. Upload the built package from the following command: python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/deme-<VERSION>.tar.gz

NOTE: You will be prompted for a username after step 5. Enter '__token__' as the username, and enter your PyPi token obtained
from the UW-SBEL pypi.org account.

Conda distributions:

To perform a conda distribution, follow the steps listed below:

1. Define DEME version in setup.py's setup function and in recipe/meta.yaml (Both versions should be the same!)
2. Define desired python version in recipe/meta.yaml in the requirement sections for build, host and run.
3. Checkout all required submodules
4. Run the following command in DEM-Engine's root directory to build a conda package: conda build . -c conda-forge --python=<DESIRED_VERSION>
5. If build successful, note location of DEM-Engine's conda package listed near the end of logs during build process. (Should be in anaconda3/conda-bld/linux-64/ folder, although not guaranteed)
6. Download anaconda-client from the following command: conda install anaconda-client
7. Run the following command to login to your Anaconda account: anaconda login
8. Run anaconda upload <PACKAGE_NAME>
