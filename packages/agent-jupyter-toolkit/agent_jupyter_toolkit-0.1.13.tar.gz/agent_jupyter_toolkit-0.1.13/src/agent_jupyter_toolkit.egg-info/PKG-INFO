           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Agent Jupyter Toolkit

A Python toolkit for building agent tools that interact with Jupyter kernels and the Jupyter protocol. This package provides high-level wrappers and abstractions around [jupyter_client](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-client/), making it easy to manage kernels, execute code, and build agent-driven workflows for automation, orchestration, and integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Features
- High-level, async-friendly wrappers for Jupyter kernel management and code execution
- Session and variable management for agent tools
- Designed for use in agent toolkits, automation, and MCP server backends
- Extensible hooks and integration points for custom workflows

## Use Cases
- Build agent tools that execute code in Jupyter kernels
- Integrate Jupyter kernel execution into MCP servers or other orchestration systems
- Automate notebook and code execution for data science, ML, and automation pipelines

## Installation

You can install the package and its dependencies from PyPI or set up a development environment using pip or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

### Install from PyPI

```sh
# Using pip
pip install agent-jupyter-toolkit

# Or using uv
uv pip install agent-jupyter-toolkit
```

### Environment Setup

### Development Environment (contributors)

#### Option 1: Using pip

```sh
# Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10+ recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

#### Option 2: Using uv

```sh
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies
uv pip install '.[dev]'
```

## Configuration

- All configuration is managed via `pyproject.toml`.
- Development dependencies and test tools are specified in the `[project.optional-dependencies]` section.
- See `tox.ini` for test and linting environments.

## Reference: jupyter_client

[jupyter_client](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-client/) is the reference implementation of the Jupyter protocol, providing client and kernel management APIs. This toolkit builds on top of jupyter_client to provide a more ergonomic, agent-oriented interface for automation and integration.

## Project Goals

- Define reusable components and abstractions for agent tools that interact with Jupyter kernels
- Enable both direct use in agent toolkits and integration as part of an MCP server
- Provide a robust, modern, and extensible foundation for agent-driven Jupyter workflows


## Release Process

To publish a new release to PyPI:

1. Ensure all changes are committed and tests pass:
    ```sh
    uv run pytest
    ```

2. Create and push an **annotated tag** for the release:
    ```sh
    git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "Release 0.1.2"
    git push origin v0.1.2
    ```

3. Checkout the tag to ensure you are building exactly from it:
    ```sh
    git checkout v0.1.2
    ```

4. Clean old build artifacts:
    ```sh
    rm -rf dist
    rm -rf build
    rm -rf src/*.egg-info
    ``` 

5. Upgrade build and upload tools:
    ```sh
    uv pip install --upgrade build twine packaging setuptools wheel setuptools_scm
    ```

6. Build the package:
    ```sh
    uv run python -m build
    ```

7. (Optional) Check metadata:
    ```sh
    uv run twine check dist/*
    ```

8. Upload to PyPI:
    ```sh
    uv run twine upload dist/*
    ```

**Notes:**
* Twine ≥ 6 and packaging ≥ 24.2 are required for modern metadata support.
* Always build from the tag (`git checkout vX.Y.Z`) so setuptools_scm resolves the exact version.
* `git checkout v0.1.2` puts you in detached HEAD mode; that’s normal. When done, return to your branch with:
    ```sh
    git switch -
    ```
* If you’re building in CI, make sure tags are fetched:
    ```sh
    git fetch --tags --force --prune
    git fetch --unshallow || true
    ```

---

See the `tests/` directory for usage examples and test coverage.  
Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Fix Ruff

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install your package in editable mode with dev tools
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# ruff: lint + fix
ruff check src tests --fix

# black: format
black src tests
```
