# Contribute

Great that you see this page and want to contribute!

:::{tip}
All contributions are welcome!
Think of corrections on the manual, code and more or better tests.
:::

The `Linkaudit` repository is hosted at [Github](tbd)

Simple Guidelines:

* Questions, Feature Requests, Bug Reports should all be reported on the [Github Issue Tracker](tbd) .
* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is used for code style. But for a simple fix, using `Black` is not required!

Test scripts require installation of:
* `pytest` and
* `pytest-asyncio` to run the `asyncio` tests.



:::{warning}
This simple tool is meant to keep simple. 
Special feature requests are possible, but will probably only be realized after a quote and paid invoice.
