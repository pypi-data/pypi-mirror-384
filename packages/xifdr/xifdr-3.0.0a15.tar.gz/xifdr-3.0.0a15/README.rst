xiFDR
=====

xiFDR is a tool for crosslink mass spectrometry (CLMS) false discovery rate (FDR) estimation
and crosslink spectrum match (CSM) aggregation. Usual applications are the extraction of residue links
or protein-protein interactions (PPIs) above a desired significance threshold.
Further, xiFDR supports *boosting* of FDR levels to obtain the largest possible number of residue-links
or PPIs by finding the optimal FDR thresholds.
