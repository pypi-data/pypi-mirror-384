    Protocol for components that need to respond to node lifecycle events.

    This protocol enables clean, event-driven initialization and management of

    ad-hoc initialization patterns with a structured event-based approach.

    Components implementing this protocol can be registered with nodes to
    receive lifecycle events and perform their specific setup, processing,
    and cleanup tasks at the appropriate times.

    All methods have default implementations (empty/pass-through), so implementing
    classes only need to override the events they care about.
