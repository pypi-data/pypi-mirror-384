# Revolution EDA Schematic/Symbol/Layout Editors and Simulation and Analysis Environment

## Introduction

Revolution EDA is a new generation of schematic and symbol editor targeting custom integrated
circuit design with integrated simulation and plotting capabilities.

## Core Features

1. **Advanced Symbol Creation**: Create symbols with both common symbol attributes and instance
   parameters. Instance parameters can be Python functions for dynamic parameter calculation.
2. **Automatic Symbol Generation**: Generate symbols automatically from schematics and Verilog-A
   modules with support for circles, lines, rectangles, and arches.
3. **Verilog-A Integration**: Clear separation between model and instance parameters for
   Verilog-A symbols.
4. **JSON-Based File Format**: Human-readable JSON format allows easy inspection and editing
   with text editors.
5. **Configuration-Driven Netlisting**: Config view support similar to commercial tools for
   choosing simulation views.
6. **Hierarchical Netlisting**: Full hierarchical netlisting capability with Xyce simulator
   support.
7. **Python-Powered Labels**: Labels support Python functions enabling professional PDK
   development.
8. **Layout Editor**: Full-featured hierarchical layout editor with support for rectangles,
   polygons, paths, pins, labels, vias (single and array) and python-based parametric 
   layout cells. Includes layer management (selectibility and visibility
   management), and GDS import/export capabilities.
9. **Comprehensive Library Management**: Familiar library browser for creating, renaming,
   copying, and deleting libraries, cells, and views.
10. **Persistent Configuration**: Save and restore configuration parameters.
11. **Comprehensive Logging**: Error, warning, and info message logging.

## Plugin Architecture

Revolution EDA features a modular plugin architecture that enables extensible functionality. 
There are already two plugins available, *revedasim* and *revedaplot*. These plugins are not 
open-source, emphasizing the fact that Revolution EDA allows the independent Electronic 
Design Automation Software vendors a base they can build upon. Please inquire at Revolution 
EDA website

## Simulation and Plotting

There are already two plugins available developed by Revolution Semiconductor for Revolution 
EDA:

### Revolution EDA Simulation and Analysis Environment (revedasim)

- **Xyce Simulator Integration**: Full support for Xyce circuit simulator
- **Parameter Sweeps**: Multi-dimensional parameter sweep capabilities
- **Analysis Types**: Support for DC, AC, transient, noise, and harmonic balance analyses
- **Output Management**: Flexible output signal selection and processing
- **Process Management**: Efficient simulation job management

### Revolution EDA Plotter (revedaplot)

- **Very Fast**: Can handle very large datasets.
- **Imports both Raw and Ascii file output**: Can uniformly handle raw and ascii file 
  formats generated by Xyce and other circuit simulators.
- **Interactive Waveform Viewer**: Advanced plotting with zoom, pan, and measurement tools
- **Multi-Plot Support**: Combined and separate plot views
- **Parameter Sweep Visualization**: Automatic plotting of parametric simulation results
- **Export Capabilities**: High-quality plot export functionality


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or 3.13
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) dependency management tool if
  installing from source.

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install revolution-eda
```

After installation, start the program with:

```bash
reveda
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eskiyerli/revolution-eda.git
cd revolution-eda

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the application
poetry run reveda
```

### PDK Installation

To use preliminerary IHP PDK, clone the ihp_pdk repository preferably to a directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eskiyerli/ihp_pdk.git
```

If you would like to use preliminary IHP PDK, make sure that `REVEDA_PDK_PATH` variable in
`.env` file points to where it is downloaded. The `.env` file could be under package
directoryFor example, you had cloned the
repository
under
the same directory where `revolution-eda` repo is cloned, `.env` file content could be:

```
REVEDA_PDK_PATH=../ihp_pdk
```

You could also clone `example_libraries` repo to have some ideal elements and IHP sg13g2_pr
library. The second library also three layout parametric cells included for `rsil`, `cap_cmim`
and `sg13_lv_nmos`. There is no guarantee given that these parametric cells are error-free and
can be used with the relevant IHP process.

Once again, the user can clone the relevant repository to download the example libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eskiyerli/exampleLibraries.git
```

User Library Path Editor to add the paths to downloaded libraries to library browser.
