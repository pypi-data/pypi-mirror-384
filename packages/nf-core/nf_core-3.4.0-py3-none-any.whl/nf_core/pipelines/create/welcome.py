# Welcome to the nf-core pipeline creation wizard

This app will help you create a new Nextflow pipeline
from the [nf-core/tools pipeline template](https://github.com/nf-core/tools).

The template helps anyone benefit from nf-core best practices,
and is a requirement for nf-core pipelines.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want to add a pipeline to nf-core, please
> [join on Slack](https://nf-co.re/join) and discuss your plans with the
> community as early as possible; _**ideally before you start on your pipeline!**_
> See the [nf-core guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/guidelines)
> and the [#new-pipelines](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/new-pipelines)
> Slack channel for more information.
