"""
Purpose: Violation message formatting for duplicate code detection

Scope: Construction of detailed violation messages with cross-file references

Overview: Builds comprehensive violation messages for duplicate code blocks. Formats messages to
    include duplicate line count, occurrence count, and references to all other locations where
    the duplicate appears. Provides helpful context for developers to identify and refactor
    duplicated code. Follows established violation building pattern from nesting and SRP linters.

Dependencies: CodeBlock, Violation from core.types

Exports: DRYViolationBuilder class

Interfaces: DRYViolationBuilder.build_violation(block: CodeBlock, all_duplicates: list[CodeBlock],
    rule_id: str) -> Violation

Implementation: Message formatting with cross-references, location tracking, multi-file duplicate
    reporting
