"""
Purpose: Block grouping utilities for duplicate detection

Scope: Groups code blocks by file path

Overview: Provides grouping utilities for organizing code blocks by file. Used by ViolationDeduplicator
    to process blocks on a per-file basis for overlap detection. Separates grouping logic to maintain
    SRP compliance.

Dependencies: CodeBlock, Violation

Exports: BlockGrouper class

Interfaces: BlockGrouper.group_blocks_by_file(blocks), group_violations_by_file(violations)

Implementation: Simple dictionary-based grouping by file path
