"""
Purpose: Rule registry with automatic plugin discovery and registration

Scope: Dynamic rule management and discovery across all linter plugin packages

Overview: Implements rule registry that maintains a collection of registered linting rules indexed
    by rule_id. Provides methods to register individual rules, retrieve rules by identifier, list
    all available rules, and discover rules from packages using the RuleDiscovery helper. Enables
    the extensible plugin architecture by allowing rules to be added dynamically without framework
    modifications. Validates rule uniqueness and handles registration errors gracefully.

Dependencies: BaseLintRule, RuleDiscovery

Exports: RuleRegistry class with register(), get(), list_all(), and discover_rules() methods

Interfaces: register(rule: BaseLintRule) -> None, get(rule_id: str) -> BaseLintRule | None,
    list_all() -> list[BaseLintRule], discover_rules(package_path: str) -> int

Implementation: Dictionary-based registry with RuleDiscovery delegation, duplicate validation
