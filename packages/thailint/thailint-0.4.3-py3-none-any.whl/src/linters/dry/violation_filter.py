"""
Purpose: Violation overlap filtering

Scope: Filters overlapping violations within same file

Overview: Filters overlapping violations by comparing line ranges. When violations are close together
    (within 3 lines), only the first one is kept. Used by ViolationDeduplicator to remove duplicate
    reports from rolling hash windows.

Dependencies: Violation

Exports: ViolationFilter class

Interfaces: ViolationFilter.filter_overlapping(sorted_violations)

Implementation: Iterates through sorted violations, keeps first of each overlapping group
