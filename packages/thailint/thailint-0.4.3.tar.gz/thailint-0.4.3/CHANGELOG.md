## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Project Root Detection System** - Three-level precedence system for accurate configuration and ignore pattern resolution
  - `--project-root` CLI option for explicit project root specification (highest priority)
  - Automatic project root inference from `--config` path (config's parent directory becomes project root)
  - Auto-detection fallback that walks up from file location to find markers (`.git`, `.thailint.yaml`, `pyproject.toml`)
  - Priority order: `--project-root` > config inference > auto-detection
  - Click path validation (exists, is directory) with helpful error messages
  - All paths resolved to absolute paths immediately for consistency

- **Docker Sibling Directory Support** - Solves critical Docker use case where config and code are in separate directories
  - Explicit project root specification: `docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace thailint --project-root /workspace/root magic-numbers /workspace/backend/`
  - Automatic config path inference: `docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace thailint --config /workspace/root/.thailint.yaml magic-numbers /workspace/backend/`
  - Monorepo support with shared configuration across multiple projects
  - CI/CD-friendly with explicit paths preventing auto-detection issues

- **Enhanced Configuration System**
  - Config loading now respects project root context
  - Ignore patterns resolve relative to project root (not file location)
  - Config search paths: explicit `--config` > project-root/.thailint.yaml > auto-detected locations
  - Pyprojroot fallback for test environment compatibility

- **Test Suite**
  - 42 tests for project root detection (29 new + 13 updated, 100% passing)
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_project_root.py` - Explicit `--project-root` tests (15 tests)
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_config_inference.py` - Config path inference tests (14 tests)
  - Priority order tests verifying explicit > inferred > auto-detection
  - Error handling tests for invalid paths (doesn't exist, is file not directory)
  - Integration tests with real directory structures

### Changed

- **CLI Commands** - All linter commands now accept `--project-root` option
  - `thailint magic-numbers --project-root PATH [TARGET]`
  - `thailint nesting --project-root PATH [TARGET]`
  - `thailint srp --project-root PATH [TARGET]`
  - `thailint file-placement --project-root PATH [TARGET]`
  - All commands support combined usage: `--project-root` with `--config`

- **Orchestrator Initialization** - Now accepts explicit project root parameter
  - `Orchestrator(project_root=Path, config_path=Path)` signature
  - Project root passed from CLI to orchestrator for all linting operations
  - Config loading uses project root context for path resolution

- **Path Resolution** - All ignore patterns resolve relative to project root
  - Previous behavior: patterns resolved relative to file being linted
  - New behavior: patterns resolved relative to project root directory
  - More predictable and consistent ignore pattern matching
  - Better Docker compatibility with volume mounts

  - Fixed: Works with any directory structure using `--project-root` or config inference
  - Ignore patterns now resolve correctly in Docker volume mount scenarios

- **Ignore Pattern Resolution** - Patterns now resolve consistently relative to project root
  - Previous: Resolved relative to file being linted (inconsistent behavior)

- **Test Environment Compatibility** - Added pyprojroot fallback for pytest environments
  - Tests can run in isolated temporary directories
  - Auto-detection gracefully handles test scenarios without project markers
  - No impact on production code behavior

### Infrastructure

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-09

**Docker Path Validation Fix** - Fixes critical Docker image bug where file-specific linting failed due to premature path validation.

### Fixed

- **Docker Path Validation** - Removed Click's `exists=True` parameter that validated paths before Docker volumes were mounted
  - All linter commands now work with file paths in Docker: `docker run -v $(pwd):/data thailint nesting /data/file.py`
  - Better error messages when paths don't exist, with Docker usage hints
  - Manual path validation happens after argument parsing, compatible with both CLI and Docker contexts

### Changed

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-06

**Initial Alpha Release**

### Breaking Changes

**Configuration Format Update**: Multi-Linter Top-Level Sections

The configuration format has been restructured to support multiple linters with separate top-level sections. This prepares the project for future linters while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

**Old Format** (v0.1.0 and earlier):
```yaml
# .thailint.yaml
directories:
  src/:
    allow:
      - "^src/.*\\.py$"
global_patterns:
  deny:
    - pattern: ".*\\.tmp$"
      reason: "No temp files"
```

**New Format** (v0.2.0+):
```yaml
# .thailint.yaml
file-placement:
  directories:
    src/:
      allow:
        - "^src/.*\\.py$"
  global_patterns:
    deny:
      - pattern: ".*\\.tmp$"
        reason: "No temp files"
```

**Migration Steps**:
1. Wrap your entire file-placement configuration under a `file-placement:` top-level key
2. Use hyphens (`file-placement`) not underscores (`file_placement`)
3. Indent all existing configuration one level
4. Update any `.thailint.json` files similarly

**Rationale**: This change allows multiple linters to coexist cleanly. Future linters like `code-quality:` and `security:` will have their own top-level sections, following the pattern of tools like `pyproject.toml`.

### Added
- Example configuration files (`.thailint.yaml.example`, `.thailint.json.example`)
- Documentation for multi-linter configuration format

### Changed
- Configuration schema now uses top-level linter sections
- File placement linter looks for config under `file-placement` key (hyphen, not underscore)

### Deprecated
- Old flat configuration format (still works in v0.1.x but will be removed in v1.0.0)
