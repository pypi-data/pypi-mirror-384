"""
Purpose: Base violation builder class for consistent violation creation across all linters

Scope: Core violation building functionality used by all linter violation builders

Overview: Provides base classes and data structures for violation creation across all linters.
    Defines ViolationInfo dataclass containing all required and optional violation fields,
    and BaseViolationBuilder class with common build() method. Eliminates duplicate violation
    construction patterns across file_placement, nesting, and srp linters. Ensures consistent
    violation creation with proper defaults for column and severity fields. Linter-specific
    builders extend this base class to inherit common construction logic while maintaining
    their domain-specific message generation and suggestion logic.

Dependencies: dataclasses, src.core.types (Violation, Severity)

Exports: ViolationInfo dataclass, BaseViolationBuilder class

Interfaces: ViolationInfo(rule_id, file_path, line, message, column, severity),
    BaseViolationBuilder.build(info: ViolationInfo) -> Violation

Implementation: Uses dataclass for type-safe violation info, base class provides build()
    method that constructs Violation objects with proper defaults
