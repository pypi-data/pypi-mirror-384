"""
Purpose: SRP detection heuristics for analyzing code complexity and responsibility

Scope: Helper functions for method counting, LOC calculation, and keyword detection

Overview: Provides heuristic-based analysis functions for detecting Single Responsibility
    Principle violations. Implements method counting that excludes property decorators and
    special methods. Provides LOC calculation that filters out blank lines and comments.
    Includes keyword detection for identifying generic class names that often indicate SRP
    violations (Manager, Handler, etc.). Supports both Python AST and TypeScript tree-sitter
    nodes. These heuristics enable practical SRP detection without requiring perfect semantic
    analysis, focusing on measurable code metrics that correlate with responsibility scope.

Dependencies: ast module for Python AST analysis, typing for type hints

Exports: count_methods, count_loc, has_responsibility_keyword, has_property_decorator

Interfaces: Functions accepting AST nodes and returning metrics (int, bool)

Implementation: AST walking with filtering logic, heuristic-based thresholds
