"""Hybrid TDA+Neural Odometry System.

This module implements a learned odometry estimator that uses topological and geometric
features extracted from point clouds via witness complex persistence.

Architecture:
- TDA Feature Extractor: Converts point clouds â†’ persistence diagrams + geometric features
- Neural Odometry Model: Estimates relative pose (translation + rotation) between frames
- Training Pipeline: Supervised learning on KITTI odometry ground truth
- Evaluation: Compare against ICP, visual odometry, and learned baselines

Key insight: Persistent homology provides robust, rotation-invariant geometric features
that are complementary to raw point coordinates or learned CNN features.
