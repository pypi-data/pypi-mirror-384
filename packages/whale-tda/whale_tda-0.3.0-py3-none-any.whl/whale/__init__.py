"""Whale: a reusable witness-complex pipeline for large point clouds.

The :mod:`whale` package exposes the core building blocks used throughout the
repository as a lightweight library so that downstream projects can reuse the
landmark selection, witness diagram construction, and diagnostic helpers beyond
the MRI-focused command line interfaces.

All public objects are re-exported at the package root for convenience::
