"""Public package for the MRI landmark-based persistence pipeline.

The code is organised into small, composable submodules so the CLI wrappers
can be reused or adapted in isolation.  The main entry points remain::

    python -m paper_ready.mri_deep_dive
    python -m paper_ready.mri_deep_dive_fast
