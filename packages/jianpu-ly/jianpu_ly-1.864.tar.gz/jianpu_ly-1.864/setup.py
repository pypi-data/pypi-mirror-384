Jianpu in Lilypond, from http://ssb22.user.srcf.net/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html


jianpu-ly is a Python program (compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3) that assists with printing jianpu (numbered musical notation) in the GNU Lilypond music typesetter. The jianpu is written on a modiﬁed-appearance “stave” in Lilypond, which means Lilypond’s typesetting capabilities (lyric spacing, slurs, beams etc) will apply to the jianpu without needing to add a 5-line stave. If you prefer, the generated code for the jianpu stave may also be placed in a score with other types of stave.

Using jianpu-ly requires some technical knowledge.  If you don't know what a command line is, what a text editor is, what a directory is or what Python is, then please find out about these things before attempting to use jianpu-ly.  It is not an extension to Lilypond front-ends like Frescobaldi; it is a preprocessor that currently requires you to have command-line experience.

If you have problems, try a different Lilypond version.
jianpu-ly works with Lilypond 2.20, 2.22 and 2.24.

Run jianpu-ly < text-file > ly-file (or jianpu-ly text-files > ly-file).  There is experimental support for importing MusicXML via jianpu-ly piece.xml (or jianpu-ly piece.mxl > ly-file) but this does not work for all pieces.

Normal text files are whitespace-separated and can contain words like the following.  Usually the order of characters within a note does not matter, hence #1 is the same as 1# and '1 is the same as 1' and s1 is the same as 1s.

Scale going up: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1'`

Accidentals: `1 #1 2 b2 1`

Shortcuts for 1' and 2': `8 9`

Percussion beat: `x`

Change base octave: `< >`

Semiquaver, quaver, crotchet (16/8/4th notes): `s1 q1 1`

Alternate way to input semiquaver, quaver, crotchet: `1\ 1\ 1` (any \ must go after the pitch not before)

Sticky durations (4 semiquavers then crotchet): `KeepLength s1 1 1 1 c1`

Dotted versions of the above (50% longer): `s1. q1. 1.`

Alternate dotted versions: `1\. 1\.`

Demisemiquaver, hemidemisemiquaver (32/64th notes): `d1 h1`

Minims (half notes) use dashes: `1 -`

Dotted minim: `1 - -`

Semibreve (whole note): `1 - - -`

Time signature: `4/4`

Time signature with quaver anacrusis (8th-note pickup): `4/4,8`

Key signature (major): `1=Bb`

Key signature (minor): `6=F#`

Tempo: `4=85`

Lyrics: `L: here are the syl- la- bles` (all on one line, or newline after the : and double newline to end)

Lyrics (verse 1): `L: 1. Here is verse one`

Lyrics (verse 2): `L: 2. Here is verse two`

Hanzi lyrics (auto space): `H: hanzi` (with or without spaces)

Lilypond headers: `title=the title` (on a line of its own)

Guitar chords: `chords=c2. g:7 c` (on own line, or newline after the = and double newline to end)

Fret diagrams: `frets=guitar` (on own line)

Change guitar chords into Roman numerals: `ChordsRoman`

Multiple parts: `NextPart`

Instrument of current part: `instrument=Flute` (on a line of its own)

Multiple movements: `NextScore`

Prohibit page breaks until end of this movement: `OnePage`

Suppress bar numbers: `NoBarNums`

Suppress first-line indent: `NoIndent`

Ragged last line: `RaggedLast`

Old-style time signature: `SeparateTimesig 1=C 4/4`

Indonesian 'not angka' style: `angka`

Alternate Indonesian-style minim, dotted minim and semibreve: `1 . 1 . . 1 . . .` (dot is treated as dash)

Add a Western staff doubling the tune: `WithStaff`

Tuplets: `3[ q1 q1 q1 ]`

Grace notes before: `g[#45] 1`

Grace notes after: `1 ['1]g`

Grace notes with durations: `g[d4d5s6] 1`

Simple chords: `,135' 1 1b3 1`

Da capo: `1 1 Fine 1 1 1 1 1 1 DC`

Dal segno: `1 1 Segno 1 1 ToCoda 1 1 DS 1 1`

Repeat (with alternate endings): `R{ 1 1 1 } A{ 2 | 3 }`

Short repeats (percent): `R4{ 1 2 }`

Ties (like Lilypond's, if you don't want dashes): `1 ~ 1`

Slurs (like Lilypond's): `1 ( 2 )`
