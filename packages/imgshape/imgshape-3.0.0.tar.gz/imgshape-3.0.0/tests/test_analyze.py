# tests/test_analyze.py
"""
Robust test for analyze_type() that locates the sample asset in a variety
of test-run layouts. If the local asset is not present (some CI setups
run tests from a temporary working directory), this test will download a
small fallback image into the provided tmp_path.

This keeps the test deterministic and avoids brittle path assumptions.
