# Migration from "ai_django_core"

This package was previously known as [ai_django_core](https://pypi.org/project/ai-django-core/). Due to the
misleading nature of the name, we chose to rename it with something more meaningful.

The migration is really simple, just:

* Install ambient-toolbox and remove the dependency to ai-django-core
* Search and replace all usages of `from ai_django_core...` to `from ambient_toolbox...`
* The class-based mail functionality was moved to a separate package called
[django-pony-express](https://pypi.org/project/django-pony-express/).

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install ambient-toolbox`

  or via uv:

  `uv add ambient-toolbox`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    "ambient_toolbox",
)
```

- Apply migrations by running:

  `python ./manage.py migrate`

### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

- Fetch the latest changes in GitHub mirror and push them
- Trigger new build at ReadTheDocs.io (follow instructions in admin panel at RTD) if the GitHub webhook is not yet set
  up.

### Preparation and building

This package uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and building.

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `CHANGES.md`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to "master"

- This project uses uv to publish to PyPI. This will create distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

  ```bash
  uv build
  ```

### Publishing to PyPI

To publish to the production PyPI:

```bash
uv publish
```

To publish to TestPyPI first (recommended for testing):

```bash
uv publish --publish-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

You can then test the installation from TestPyPI:

```bash
uv pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ambient-package-update
```

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. This updater is rendering all important
configuration and setup files. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
