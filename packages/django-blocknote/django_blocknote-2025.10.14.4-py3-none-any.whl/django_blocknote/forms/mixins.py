class BlockNoteUserFormMixin:
    """
    Cooperative form mixin to automatically configure BlockNote widgets with user templates.

    This mixin automatically detects BlockNote widgets in form fields and configures
    them with user context for template personalization and user-specific functionality.
    It's designed to work cooperatively with other form mixins without conflicts.

    Key Features:
    - Automatic BlockNote widget detection and configuration
    - User context passing for widget personalization
    - CSV to JSON conversion for aliases fields
    - Cooperative inheritance design
    - Comprehensive debugging support
    - Graceful handling of missing user context

    Usage:
        class DocumentForm(BlockNoteUserFormMixin, forms.ModelForm):
            content = forms.CharField(widget=BlockNoteWidget())

            class Meta:
                model = Document
                fields = ['title', 'content']

        # Combined with other mixins
        class ArticleForm(TagMeModelFormMixin, BlockNoteUserFormMixin, forms.ModelForm):
            content = forms.CharField(widget=BlockNoteWidget())
            tags = TagMeCharField()

            class Meta:
                model = Article
                fields = ['title', 'content', 'tags']

    Widget Configuration:
    Automatically configures BlockNote widgets with:
    - User context for template personalization
    - Field name for widget identification
    - Any additional BlockNote-specific attributes

    Form Integration:
    The mixin expects 'user' from form kwargs (provided by view mixins):
    - Works with authenticated and anonymous users
    - Gracefully handles missing user context
    - Preserves user context for other mixins

    Cooperative Design:
    - Uses shared user extraction pattern
    - Removes 'user' from kwargs after all mixins process it
    - Maintains compatibility with Django's form system
    - Safe to use in any order with other cooperative mixins

    Performance:
    - Minimal overhead during form initialization
    - Widget configuration happens only once
    - No additional database queries
    - Thread-safe operation

    Debugging:
    Set `_debug_widget_config = True` on form class to enable detailed
    logging of widget configuration for development and troubleshooting.

        Cooperative Behavior:

        User Sharing Strategy:
        - First mixin to run extracts user with pop() and stores it
        - Subsequent mixins check for existing self.user attribute
        - This prevents TypeError from unexpected kwargs in Django forms

        After form initialization, automatically:
        - Identifies all BlockNote widgets in form fields
        - Configures widgets with user context
        - Adds field metadata for widget functionality

    Cooperative formset mixin to handle user context for forms with BlockNote widgets.

    This mixin enables BlockNote functionality in Django formsets and inline
