# **Introduction**

This Python package serves as the frontend for calculating and building a Green's function library for synthetic seismograms. The backend consists of Wang Rongjiang's program for calculating synthetic seismograms, including EDGRN/EDCMP, [QSEIS_STRESS](https://github.com/Zhou-Jiangcheng/QSEIS_2006_STRESS), SPGRN, and QSSP (Wang, 1999; Wang 2003; Wang and Wang 2007; Wang et al., 2017). The code includes two parallel modes: one using the multiprocessing library (single-node multi-process) and the other using MPI (multi-node). Traveling time is calculated using [TAUP](https://github.com/crotwell/TauP). Some geographic coordinate transformations use code from [obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy).
