    Calculates the permutation unitary for a given dictionary of swaps across
    the n_modes of a circuit.

    Args:

        swaps (dict) : The dictionary containing the target mode swaps.

        n_modes (int) : The number of modes in the circuit. If this is not the
            number of modes then an incorrect dimension unitary will be
