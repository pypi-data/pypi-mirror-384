Lightworks
==========

Lightworks is a high-level interface for photonic quantum computing,
enabling a range of transformations to be implemented and executed on both
remote photonic hardware and with local simulation tools.

Key objects:

    Circuit : Provides a tool for building linear optic circuits across a
        number of modes. Circuit also supports addition for combination of
        sub-circuits and can be used with built-in Parameter objects to allow
        for adjustment of the circuit configuration after creation. Circuit
        also has a display method so the created circuit can be viewed.

    State : Represents the photonic fock states which are input and output from
        the system. State objects are hashable, and so can be used as keys in
        dictionaries, and support both addition and merging to combine states
        together.

    emulator : Provides a set of local simulation tools for the testing and
        verification of outputs from a given problem. There is a number of
        different objects for simulation of the system, which provide various
        capabilities and outputs.

    qubit : Module for implementing the qubit paradigm of quantum computing on
        photonic linear optic systems.

    tomography : Module for performing quantum tomography on linear optic
        gate-based circuits.
