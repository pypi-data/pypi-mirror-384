    """
    A function to check if a provided matrix is unitary according to a
    certain level of precision. If finds the product of the matrix with its
    hermitian conjugate and then checks it is unitary.

    Args:

        U (np.array) : The NxN matrix which we want to check is unitary.

        precision (float, optional) : The precision which the unitary
            matrix is checked according to. If there are large float errors
            this may need to be reduced.

    Returns:

        bool : A boolean to indicate whether or not the matrix is unitary.

    Raises:

        ValueError : Raised in the event that the matrix is not square as it
            cannot be unitary.
