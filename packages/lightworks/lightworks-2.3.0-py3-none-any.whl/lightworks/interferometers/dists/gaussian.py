class Gaussian(Distribution):
    """
    Returns random values according to a Gaussian distribution with defined
    center and standard deviation. It can also be constrained to be between a
    minimum and maximum value to prevent issues with assigning invalid
    quantities. When a value is outside of the set bounds the distribution will
    be resampled until this is no longer the case. Note: care should be taken
    with setting minimum and maximum values as setting these to be too strict
    could significantly increase the time taken to produce a valid value.

    Args:

        center (float) : The center (mean) of the Gaussian distribution.

        deviation (float) : The standard deviation of the distribution.

        min_value (float | None) : The minimum allowed value for the
            distribution. Defaults to None, which will assign the min value to
            be - infinity.

        max_value (float | None) : The maximum allowed value for the
            distribution. Defaults to None, which will assign the max value to
            be + infinity.
