class Analyzer(Task):
    """
    The analyzer class is built as an alternative to simulation, intended for
    cases where we want to look at the transformations between a specific
    subset of states. It is useful for the simulation of probabilities in
    cases where loss and circuit errors are likely to be a factor. As part of
    the process a performance and error rate metric are calculated.

    Args:

        circuit (PhotonicCircuit) : The circuit to simulate.

        inputs (list) : A list of the input states to simulate. For multiple
            inputs this should be a list of States.

        expected (dict) : A dictionary containing a mapping between the input
            state and expected output state(s). If there is multiple
            possible outputs, this can be specified as a list.

    Attribute:

        performance : The total probabilities of mapping between the states
            provided compared with all possible states.

        error_rate : Given an expected mapping, the analyzer will determine the
            extent to which this is achieved.
