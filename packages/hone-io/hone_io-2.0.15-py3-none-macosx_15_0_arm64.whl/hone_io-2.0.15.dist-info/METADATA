# Hone-io Community Edition - QCML Scikit-Learn Integration

Welcome to the **Honeio Community Edition**! This package provides scikit-learn compatible wrappers for Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) models. Documentation available [here](https://qognitive-qcog-core.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

## 🚀 What is QCML?

**Quantum Cognition Machine Learning** is a new form of machine learning that is inspired by quantum cognition.
QCML models learn a representation of the input data into quantum states, and the outputs of the models reflect the outcomes of quantum measurements.
QCML is highly effective on datasets with a large number of input features and a large number of classes (for classification) or targets (for regression).

For more details you can check out some of our publications:

## 📦 Available Classes

### `QCMLRegressor`
A scikit-learn compatible regressor for continuous target prediction tasks.

### `QCMLClassifier`
A scikit-learn compatible classifier for discrete classification tasks.

Both classes wrap the underlying QCML layers with scikit-learn wrapper and provide familiar scikit-learn interfaces.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Scikit-learn compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for sklearn estimators
- **Quantum-inspired learning**: Represents data with quantum states
- **Adaptive weighting**: Learnable input feature weights for automatic feature selection
- **GPU support**: Train on CPU or CUDA devices
- **Model persistence**: Save and load trained models
- **Flexible batching**: Support for batch training or full-batch optimization
