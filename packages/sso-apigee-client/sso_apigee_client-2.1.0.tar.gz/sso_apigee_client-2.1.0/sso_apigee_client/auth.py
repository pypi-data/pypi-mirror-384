"""Authentication utilities for FastAPI integration.

Note: This module is for SSO functionality and will be moved to a separate SSO SDK.
For APIGEE-only functionality, use the ApigeeClient directly.

# This file is intentionally minimal as SSO functionality
# will be in a separate SDK. For now, it's kept for backwards compatibility
# but should not be used for new implementations.

# TODO: Move this to separate SSO SDK when SSO functionality is implemented
