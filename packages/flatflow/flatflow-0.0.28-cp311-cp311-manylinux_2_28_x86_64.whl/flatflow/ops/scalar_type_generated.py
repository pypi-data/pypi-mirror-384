# This table defines data types to identify the precision of each tensor
# operation in the computational graph of a given model. It is based on
# c10 scalar types, while types that are planned to be deprecated including
# qint8 and bits2x4, or types that remain for historical reasons such as
# complex64 are omitted.
#
# The latest version of c10 scalar types can be found at
# https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/c10/core/ScalarType.h
# or at https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html.
#
# Note that these data types are incomplete and more data types will be added
# in the future.
