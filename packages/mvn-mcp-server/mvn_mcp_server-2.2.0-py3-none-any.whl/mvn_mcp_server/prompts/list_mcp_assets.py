## üìù Prompts
Interactive conversation starters and guided workflows:

‚Ä¢ **list_mcp_assets** () - Comprehensive overview of all server capabilities
‚Ä¢ **triage** (service_name, workspace) - Analyze dependencies and vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ **plan** (service_name, priorities) - Create actionable update plan from triage

## üîß Tools
Maven dependency management and analysis functions:

### Version Management
‚Ä¢ **check_version_tool** (dependency, version, packaging, classifier) - Check version and get update info
‚Ä¢ **check_version_batch_tool** (dependencies) - Process multiple version checks efficiently
‚Ä¢ **list_available_versions_tool** (dependency, version, include_all_versions) - List versions by tracks

### Security Scanning
‚Ä¢ **scan_java_project_tool** (workspace, scan_mode, severity_filter, max_results) - Scan for vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ **analyze_pom_file_tool** (pom_file_path, include_vulnerability_check) - Analyze single POM file

## üìÇ Resources
Dynamic data and persistent state:

‚Ä¢ **triage://reports/{service_name}/latest** - Latest triage report for a service
‚Ä¢ **plans://updates/{service_name}/latest** - Current update plan for a service
‚Ä¢ **assets://server/capabilities** - Dynamic server capabilities list

## üéØ Quick Start Workflow

### Enterprise Dependency Management Pattern

1. **Analyze Dependencies**
   ```
   Use prompt: triage
   Arguments: service_name="my-service", workspace="./my-service"
   Result: Comprehensive analysis stored in triage://reports/my-service/latest
   ```

2. **Review Triage Report**
   ```
   Access resource: triage://reports/my-service/latest
   Contains: Vulnerabilities, outdated dependencies, POM analysis, recommendations
   ```

3. **Create Update Plan**
   ```
   Use prompt: plan
   Arguments: service_name="my-service", priorities=["CRITICAL", "HIGH"]
   Result: Actionable plan stored in plans://updates/my-service/latest
   ```

4. **Execute Updates**
   ```
   Use individual tools to implement specific updates following the plan:
   - check_version_tool for validation
   - scan_java_project_tool for verification
   ```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Workflow Optimization
‚Ä¢ **Triage First**: Always start with triage for comprehensive analysis
‚Ä¢ **Resource Persistence**: Triage reports and plans are automatically stored and retrievable
‚Ä¢ **Batch Processing**: Use check_version_batch_tool for multiple dependencies
‚Ä¢ **Scan Modes**: Use scan_mode="pom_only" for large projects to avoid token limits

### Traceability
‚Ä¢ **Full Audit Trail**: Every plan task links back to specific triage findings
‚Ä¢ **CVE Tracking**: Plans include specific CVE IDs and remediation guidance
‚Ä¢ **Progress Tracking**: Plans track implementation status and completion

### Best Practices
‚Ä¢ **Phase-Based Updates**: Follow plan phases (Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low)
‚Ä¢ **Verification Steps**: Each phase includes verification using security scanning
‚Ä¢ **Documentation**: Plans include specific file locations and change instructions

## üîÑ Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start comprehensive triage analysis
Use prompt: triage with service_name="user-service"

# 2. Review findings (stored automatically)
Access: triage://reports/user-service/latest

# 3. Generate focused update plan
Use prompt: plan with service_name="user-service", priorities=["CRITICAL"]

# 4. Implement critical security updates
Follow plan tasks with full traceability to CVE findings

# 5. Verify security improvements
Use tool: scan_java_project_tool to confirm vulnerabilities resolved
```
