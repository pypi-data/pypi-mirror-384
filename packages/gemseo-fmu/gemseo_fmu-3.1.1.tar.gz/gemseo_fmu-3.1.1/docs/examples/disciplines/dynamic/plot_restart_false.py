# !!! note
#     We had to set `restart` to `False`
#     as the default behavior of the
#     [DynamicFMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.dynamic_fmu_discipline.DynamicFMUDiscipline]
#     is to run each execution from the start time.
#
# Then,
# we execute the discipline setting a simulation time of 0.3 seconds
# with the default input values:
discipline.set_next_execution(simulation_time=0.3)
discipline.execute()

# %%
# and store the time evolution of the position of the mass:
time_evolution_1 = (discipline.time, discipline.local_data["y"])

# %%
# We repeat this experiment with custom input values:
discipline.set_next_execution(simulation_time=0.3)
discipline.execute({"mass.m": 1.5, "spring.c": 1050.0})

# %%
# store the results:
time_evolution_2 = (discipline.time, discipline.local_data["y"])

# %%
# and execute the discipline until the final time:
discipline.execute()
time_evolution_3 = (discipline.time, discipline.local_data["y"])

# %%
# Lastly,
# we draw this trajectory on a chart:
plt.plot(*time_evolution_1, label="Default 1/3")
plt.plot(*time_evolution_2, label="Default 2/3")
plt.plot(*time_evolution_3, label="Default 3/3")
