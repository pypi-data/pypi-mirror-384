# %%
# Let us create a discipline
# to simulate a mass damper defined in a FMU model
# from 0 to 1 second with a time step of 0.1 millisecond:
#
# ![ ](../../../../images/mass_damper.png)
#
# We only use the mass of the sliding mass [kg]
# and the spring constant [N/m] as inputs
# and the position of the mass [m] as output.

    time_step=0.0001,

# %%
# Firstly,
# we simulate the FMU with the default input values,
# and in particular a constant value for the mass:
discipline.execute()

# %%
# and store the time evolution of both its position and the mass:
default_y_evolution = discipline.local_data["y"]
default_mass = discipline.local_data["mass.m"]

# %%
# Then,
# we repeat the experiment with a custom time series for the mass,
# characterized by a sharp change after 0.5 seconds.

# %%
# Lastly,
# we use a chart to compare the positions of the mass:
