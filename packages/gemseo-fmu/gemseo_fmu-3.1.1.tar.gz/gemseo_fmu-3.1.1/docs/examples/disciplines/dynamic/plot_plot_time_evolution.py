# %%
# Let us create a discipline
# to simulate a mass damper defined in an FMU model
# from 0 to 1 second with a time step of 0.1 milliseconds:
#
# ![ ](../../../../images/mass_damper.png)
#
# We only use the mass of the sliding mass [kg]
# and the spring constant [N/m] as inputs.
# The position of the mass [m] is used as output.
discipline = DynamicFMUDiscipline(
    get_fmu_file_path("Mass_Damper"),
    ["mass.m", "spring.c"],
    ["y"],
    initial_time=0.0,
    final_time=1.0,
    time_step=0.0001,
)

# %%
# Firstly,
# we execute the discipline:
discipline.execute()

# %%
# Then,
# we can easily access the local data, *e.g* the output `"y"`:
discipline.local_data["y"]

# %%
# But it is not very easy to read
# and plotting the time evolution of this variable is a better option:
discipline.plot("y", save=False, show=True)

# %%
# We can also restrict the view to a specific time window
# defined by the start time index:
discipline.plot("y", time_window=3000, save=False, show=True)

# %%
# or both the start and end time indices:
discipline.plot("y", time_window=[3000, 7000], save=False, show=True)
