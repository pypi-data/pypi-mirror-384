# Let us create a discipline

# We only use the mass of the sliding mass [kg]
# and the spring constant [N/m] as inputs
# and the position of the mass [m] as output.

# Firstly,
# we simulate the FMU with the default input values:
discipline.execute()

# %%
# and store the time evolution of the position of the mass:
default_y_evolution = discipline.local_data["y"]

# %%
# Then,
# we repeat the experiment with custom values
# of the mass and spring constants:
discipline.execute({"mass.m": 1.5, "spring.c": 1050.0})

# %%
# Lastly,
# we use a chart to compare the positions of the mass:
