# Let us create a discipline based on an FMU model
# computing the output $y$ from the inputs $u_1$ and $u_2$
# as $y=f(u_1,u_2)=k_1u_1+k_2u_2$:
discipline = StaticFMUDiscipline(get_fmu_file_path("add"))

# %%
# We can have a look to the default inputs:
discipline.default_input_data

# %%
# and see that they are equal to zero.
# We can also see that $k_1$ and $k_2$ are discipline inputs
# in the same way as $u_1$ and $u_2$.
# However,
# their causality is _parameter_
# while the causality of $u_1$ and $u_2$ is _input_:
discipline.causalities_to_variable_names

# %%
# Then,
# we can execute the discipline with the default input values
discipline.execute()
discipline.get_output_data()

# %%
# and check that the output is equal to 0 as expected.
# Then,
# we can execute this discipline with new input values:
discipline.execute({"u1": 2.0, "u2": 3.0})
discipline.get_output_data()

# %%
# and check that the output is equal to 5 as expected.
# Lastly,
# we can also change the values of the inputs with _parameter_ causality:
discipline.execute({"u1": 2.0, "u2": 3.0, "add.k1": 4.0})
discipline.get_output_data()

# %%
# The output is equal to 11 as expected.
