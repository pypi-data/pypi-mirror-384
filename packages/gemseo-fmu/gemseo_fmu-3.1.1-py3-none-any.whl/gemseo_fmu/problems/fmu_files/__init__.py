"""A set of platform-dependent FMU models.

These CS FMU models available in linux and win32 versions are used for

- testing the functionalities of `gemseo-fmu` through [unit and functional tests](https://gitlab.com/gemseo/dev/gemseo-fmu/-/tree/develop/tests),
- illustrating these functionalities through [examples in the documentation](https://gemseo.gitlab.io/dev/gemseo-fmu/latest/generated/examples/disciplines/).

Note that `gemseo-fmu` was also used to
simulate proprietary FMU models generated from Simulink,
in isolation or in combination.

Here is the list of the FMU models available in this sub-package:

| Model                    | FMI | Description                          | Generated from        |
|--------------------------|-----|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| add.fmu                  |  2  | A linear combination                 | OpenModelica          |
| FMU3Model.fmu            |  3  | A model incrementing the output      | PythonFMU3            |
| Mass_Damper.fmu          |  2  | A mass-damper model                  | OpenModelica          |
| MassSpringSystem.fmu     |  2  | A model with springs and two masses  | OpenModelica          |
| MassSpringSubSystem1.fmu |  2  | A part of MassSpringSystem.fmu       | OpenModelica          |
| MassSpringSubSystem2.fmu |  2  | Another part of MassSpringSystem.fmu | OpenModelica          |
| ramp.fmu                 |  2  | A ramp model                         | OpenModelica          |
