    abstract = {This paper introduces novel weighted conformal p-values and methods for model-free selective inference. The problem is as follows: given test units with covariates X and missing responses Y, how do we select units for which the responses Y are larger than user-specified values while controlling the proportion of false positives? Can we achieve this without modelling assumptions on the data and without restriction on the model for predicting the responses? Last, methods should be applicable when there is a covariate shift between training and test data, which commonly occurs in practice. We answer these questions by first leveraging any prediction model to produce a class of well-calibrated weighted conformal p-values, which control the type-I error in detecting a large response. These  p-values cannot be passed onto classical multiple testing procedures since they may not obey a well-known positive dependence property. Hence, we introduce weighted conformal selection, a new procedure that controls the false discovery rate in finite samples. Besides prediction-assisted candidate selection, weighted conformal selection (i) allows us to infer multiple individual treatment effects, and (ii) extends to outlier detection with inlier distribution shifts. We demonstrate performance via simulations and applications to causal inference, drug discovery and outlier detection datasets.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

In particular, we show that a weighted version of conformal prediction can be used to compute distribution-free prediction intervals for problems in which the test and training covariate distributions differ, but the likelihood ratio between the two distributions is known—or, in practice, can be estimated accurately from a set of unlabeled data (test covariate points). Our weighted extension of conformal prediction also applies more broadly, to settings in which the data satisfies a certain weighted notion of exchangeability. We discuss other potential applications of our new conformal methodology, including latent variable and missing data problems.},
