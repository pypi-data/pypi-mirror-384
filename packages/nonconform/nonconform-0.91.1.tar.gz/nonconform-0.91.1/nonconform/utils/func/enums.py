        BETA_BINOMIAL: Beta-binomial distribution for drawing validation fractions.
            Allows tunable mean and variance through alpha/beta parameters.
        UNIFORM: Discrete uniform distribution over a specified range.
            Simple and controlled selection within [p_min, p_max].
        GRID: Discrete distribution over a specified set of values.
            Targeted control with custom probabilities for each p value.
