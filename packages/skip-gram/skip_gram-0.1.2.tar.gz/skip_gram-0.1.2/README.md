# SkipGram-HS ðŸ§ 

A PyTorch implementation of the Skip-Gram model with Hierarchical Softmax from scratch.

## Features

- Train skip-gram embeddings on your own corpus or NLTK's Brown corpus.
- Hierarchical softmax for efficient training on large vocabularies.
- Save trained embeddings and training loss history.
- Analogy evaluation (e.g., king - man + woman â‰ˆ queen).

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/agentksimha/skip_gram.git
