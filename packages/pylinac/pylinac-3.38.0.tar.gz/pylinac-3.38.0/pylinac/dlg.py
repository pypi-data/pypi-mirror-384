        Parameters
        ----------
        gaps
            The gaps (i.e. overlap) of the leaves in mm.
            These should typically be in descending order and also be negative. E.g. (-1, ..., -2.2).

        mlc
            The MLC type/arrangement. This lets us know where the leaf centers are to take a profile along.

        y_field_size
            The field size along the y-dimension (perpendicular to the leaf travel). This will determined which leaves
            are associated with which gap.

        profile_width
            The width of the profile to take along the axes parallel to leaf motion. This should be a good bit wider
            than the gap values. The default is reasonable and it is unlikely it needs tweaking.
