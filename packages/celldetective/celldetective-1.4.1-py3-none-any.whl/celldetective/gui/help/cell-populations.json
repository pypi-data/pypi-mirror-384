        "yes": "Currently, celldetective does not support the analysis of interactions between more than two cell populations at once. We recommend studying interactions between two populations at a time, or grouping similar populations together (e.g., effector-like vs target-like cells). Later, you can use celldetective's classification tools to break down the results by individual cell population.",

If you're unsure about the exact definitions, choose a convention and apply it consistently. Please note, the non-generalist deep learning models in celldetective may treat these populations slightly differently."
