"""
This library defines the metadata format used by the sidecar files that accompany
the images produced by Hyperfield satellites.

The core library used is pydantic which among other nice things allows us to
(de)serialize (from)to JSON .

If you are interested on reading from the Hyperfield metadata database into such
objects then you want to look at the `hyperfield-db` project.
