    The logic for one axis fast scan, used in fast_scan_1d and fast_scan_grid

    In this scan:
    1) The motor moves to the starting point.
    2) The motor speed is changed
    3) The motor is set in motion toward the end point
    4) During this movement detectors are triggered and read out until
        the endpoint is reached or stopped.
    5) Clean up, reset motor speed.

    Note: This is purely software triggering which result in variable accuracy.
    However, fast scan does not require encoder and hardware setup and should
    work for all motor. It is most frequently use for alignment and
    slow motion measurements.
