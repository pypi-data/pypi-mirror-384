Setup Developer Environment
===========================

This document outlines the steps to set up a developer environment for the ``sm_bluesky`` project. You can choose to develop within a VSCode devcontainer or using a local virtual environment.

Setup Github account
--------------------
If you have not yet had a Github account, please create one and upload your public SSH key to your Github account.
You can get instruction from Github on how to generate SSH key and upload it to your account.

Clone the Repository
--------------------

To clone the repository locally, use `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__

**SSH (Recommended):**

.. code:: bash

    git clone ssh://git@github.com/DiamondLightSource/sm-bluesky

**HTTPS:**

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/sm-bluesky.git

.. tip::

    SSH is the recommended method. To set up SSH keys for Git, follow the instructions : `here. <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`__

Install Dependencies
--------------------

You can choose to develop on your host machine using a ``venv`` (Python 3.10 or later required) or within a container using `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: VSCode Devcontainer

        **On a Diamond Light Source terminal:**

        .. code:: bash

            module load vscode
            code ./sm-bluesky

        Once VSCode is running:

        1.  Change the container runtime to Podman (recommended at DLS). Press ``Ctrl+Shift+P`` (or ``Cmd+Shift+P`` on macOS) and type:

            .. code:: none

                Dev Containers: Settings

            In the settings, navigate to ``User > Dev > Containers: Docker Path`` and change the value to ``podman``.

        2.  Press ``Ctrl+Shift+P`` (or ``Cmd+Shift+P`` on macOS) to open the command palette and type:

            .. code:: none

                Dev Containers: Rebuild Container

            This will build the development container.

        .. tip::

            * For development on Windows, you can use WSL and Docker Desktop. More details are available `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers>`__.
            * For setting up VSCode devcontainers outside of Diamond Light Source, refer to this `guide <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers>`__.

        .. note::

            If you are at DLS and Podman is not set up, follow these `instructions <https://dev-portal.diamond.ac.uk/guide/containers/tutorials/podman/#enable-use-of-vscode-features>`__ to install Podman and configure it for devcontainer features. Then, follow the general devcontainer setup `instructions <https://dev-portal.diamond.ac.uk/guide/containers/tutorials/devcontainer/>`__.

    .. tab-item:: Local Virtual Environment

        .. code:: bash

            python3.11 -m venv venv_p99
            source venv_p99/bin/activate
            cd sm-bluesky
            pip install -e '.[dev]'
