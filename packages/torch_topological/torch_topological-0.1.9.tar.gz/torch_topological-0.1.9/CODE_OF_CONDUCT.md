# Code of conduct

Developing is a fundamentally collaborative endeavour. Whenever human
beings interact, there is a potential for conflict. At the same time,
there is an even greater potential to build something that is 'bigger
than the sum of its parts.' In this spirit, all contributors shall be
aware of the following guidelines:

1. Be tolerant of opposing views.
2. Be mindful of the way you utter your critiques; ensure that what you
   write is objective and does not attack a person or contain any
   disparaging remarks.
3. Be forgiving when interpreting the words and actions of others;
   always assume good intentions.

We want contributors to participate in a respectful, collaborative, and
overall productive space here. Any harassment will **not** be tolerated.
