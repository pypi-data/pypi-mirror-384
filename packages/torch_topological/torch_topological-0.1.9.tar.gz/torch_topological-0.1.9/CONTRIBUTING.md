# How to contribute to `pytorch-topological`

As the saying goes: 'Many hands make light work.' Thanks for being
willing to contribute to `pytorch-topological`! Here are some resources
to get you started:

- Check out the [road map](ROADMAP.md) of the project for a high-level
  overview of current directions.
- Check out [open issues](/issues) in case you are looking for things
  to tackle.

**When contributing code, please be aware that your contribution will
fall under the terms of the [license](https://github.com/aidos-lab/pytorch-topological/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
of `pytorch-topological`.**

## Pull requests

If you propose some changes, a pull request is the easiest way to
integrate them. Please be mindful of the coding conventions (see below)
and [write good commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

## Coding conventions

Above all, consider that this is *open source software*. It is meant
to be used and extended by many people. Be mindful of them by making
your code look nice and appealing to them. We cannot build upon some
module no one understands.

As a way to obtain some consistency in all contributions, your code
should ideally be conform with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
You can check this using the great [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) tool:

```console
$ flake8 script.py
```

When creating a pull request, your code will be automatically checked
for coding convention conformity.
