Python package for highly flexible function-valued Gaussian processes (fvGP)

It is recommended to use this package via [gpCAM](https://gpcam.lbl.gov/).

Specialties: Extreme-Scale GPs, GPs Tailored for HPC training, Advanced Kernel Designs, Domain-Aware Stochastic Function Approximation

Coming soon: All those capabilitites for stochastic manifold learning

fvGP holds the world record for exact large-scale Gaussian Processes!

This package uses the HGDL package of David Perryman and Marcus Noack, which
is based on the [HGDN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037704271730225X) algorithm by Noack and Funke.
