Type-safe configuration manager for Python projects using descriptors and ConfigParser.

Full documentation: [confkit docs](https://HEROgold.github.io/confkit/)

## Supported Python Versions

confkit follows the [Python version support policy](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) as outlined in the Python Developer's Guide:

- We support all active and maintenance releases of Python, starting with 3.11
- End-of-life (EOL) Python versions are **not** supported
- We aim to support Python release candidates to stay ahead of the release cycle

This ensures that confkit remains compatible with current Python versions while allowing us to leverage modern language features.

## What is it?

confkit is a Python library that provides type-safe configuration management with automatic type conversion and validation.
It uses descriptors to define configuration values as class attributes that automatically read from and write to INI files.

## What does it do?

- Type-safe configuration with automatic type conversion
- Automatic INI file management
- Default value handling with file persistence
- Optional value support
- Enum support (Enum, StrEnum, IntEnum, IntFlag)
- Method decorators for injecting configuration values
- Runtime type validation
