[CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) is a python API to connect to various car services. If you want to automatically forward the data collected from your vehicle to [A Better Routeplanner (ABRP)](https://abetterrouteplanner.com) this plugin will help you.

### Install using PIP
If you want to use the CarConnectivity Plugin for ABRP, the easiest way is to obtain it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/carconnectivity-plugin-abrp/). Just install it using:
```bash
pip3 install carconnectivity-plugin-abrp
```
after you installed CarConnectivity

## Configuration
In your carconnectivity.json configuration add a section for the abrp plugin like this. A documentation of all possible config options can be found [here](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity-plugin-abrp/tree/main/doc/Config.md).
```
{
    "carConnectivity": {
        "connectors": [
            ...
        ]
        "plugins": [
            {
                "type": "abrp",
                "config": {
                    "tokens": {
                        "TMBLJ9NY8SF000000": "1623fdc3-4aaf-49f5-b51a-1e55435435da2",
                        "TMLLJ9NY23F000000": "12afe123-59d4-8a3d-b9ef-29367de7f8749"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
To retrieve your token go to your vehicle on [A Better Routeplanner (ABRP)](https://abetterrouteplanner.com) select "Live Data" and then link your vehicle using the "Generic" section. It will display you the token to paste in the configuration. You need to configure a mapping between the VIN and the token for each vehicle you want to connect to [ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com)
