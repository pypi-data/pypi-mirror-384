  /// Once the specification has been fulfilled, the controller is
  /// free to do anything.  If \a loop is false, the Mealy machine
  /// will jump to an accepting state to reflect that.  If \a loop is
  /// true, the mealy machine will simply stutter (i.e., jump back to
  /// the previous state).  Both options produce valid strategy.  The
  /// former one is slightly larger but more readable.
