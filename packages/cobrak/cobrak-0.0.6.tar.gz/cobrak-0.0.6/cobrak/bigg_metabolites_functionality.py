    As of Sep 14 2024, a BIGG metabolites list of all BIGG-included metabolites
    is retrievable under http://bigg.ucsd.edu/data_access

    Arguments
    ----------
    * bigg_metabolites_file_path: str ~ The file path to the BIGG metabolites file.
      The usual file name (which has to be included too in this argument) is
      bigg_models_metabolites.txt
    * output_folder: str ~ The folder in which the JSON including the parsed BIGG
      metabolites file data is stored with the name 'bigg_id_name_mapping.json'

    Output
    ----------
    * A JSON file with the name 'bigg_id_name_mapping.json' in the given output folder,
      with the following structure:
    <pre>
     {
         "$BIGG_ID": "$CHEMICAL_OR_USUAL_NAME",
         (...),
         "$BIGG_ID": "$BIGG_ID",
         (...),
     }
    </pre>
    The BIGG ID <-> BIGG ID mapping is done for models which already use the BIGG IDs.
