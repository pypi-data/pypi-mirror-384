"""Contains all dataclasses (and enums) used by COBRAk to define a metabolic model and its extra constraints and optimization objective.

Dataclasses are similar to structs in C: They are not intended to have member functions, only other types of member variables.
The main dataclass used by COBRAk is Model, which contains the full information about the metabolic model. As member variables,
a Model contains further dataclasses (such as Reaction, Metabolite, ...).
As dataclass_json is also invoked, it is possible to store and load the COBRAk dataclasses as JSON.
