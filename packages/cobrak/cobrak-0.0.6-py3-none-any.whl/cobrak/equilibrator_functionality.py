    """Cobrapy model wrapper for the ΔG'° determination of reactions using the eQuilibrator-API.

    Reactions are identified according to all annotation (in the cobrapy reaction's annotation member variable)
    given in this modules global USED_IDENTIFIERS list.

    Args:
        sbml_path (str): The path to the SBML-encoded constraint-based metabolic model for which ΔG'° values are determined.
        inner_to_outer_compartments (List[str]): A list with compartment IDs going from inner (e.g., in E. coli,
            the cytosol or 'c' in iML1515) to outer (e.g., the extracellular component or 'e' in iML1515). Used
            for the ΔG'° calculation in multi-compartmental reactions.
        phs (Dict[str, float]): A dictionary with compartment IDs as keys and the compartment pHs as values.
        pmgs (Dict[str, float]): A dictionary with compartment IDs as keys and the compartment pMgs as values.
        ionic_strengths (Dict[str, float]): A dictionary with compartment IDs as keys and the ionic strengths as values.
        potential_differences (Dict[Tuple[str, str], float]): A dictionary containing tuples with 2 elements describing
            the ID of an innter and outer compartment, and the potential difference between them.
        max_uncertainty (float): The maximal accepted uncertainty value (defaults to 1000 kJ⋅mol⁻¹). If a calculated uncertainty
            is higher than this value, the associated ΔG'° is *not* used (i.e., the specific reaction gets no ΔG'°).
        calculate_multicompartmental (bool): If True, multicompartmental reactions also get a ΔG'° using the eQuilibrator's special
            routine for them. Defaults to True.
        ignored_metabolites (list[str]): List of metabolites that shall be ignored in reaction stoichiometries (e.g., for pseudo-metabolites)
            such as enzyme_pool in certain enzyme-constrained models. Defaults to [].

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]: A dictionary with the reaction IDs as keys, and dictionaries as values which,
            in turn, contain the ΔG'° of a reaction under the key 'dG0' and the calculated uncertainty as 'uncertainty'.
