# MBO Utilities

General Python and shell utilities developed for the Miller Brain Observatory (MBO) workflows.

Most functions have examples in docstrings.

Converting scanimage tiffs into intermediate filetypes for preprocessing or to use with Suite2p is covered [here](https://millerbrainobservatory.github.io/mbo_utilities/assembly.html).

Function examples [here](https://millerbrainobservatory.github.io/mbo_utilities/api/usage.html) are a work in progress.

## Installation

This package is fully installable with `pip`.

`conda` can still be used for the virtual environment, but be mindful to only install packages with `conda install` when absolutely necessary.

Make sure your environment is activated, be that conda, venv, or uv (recommended, just pre-pend uv to all below pip commands).

To get the minimal mbo_utilities, without 3D axial correction or GUI functionality:

``` bash
pip install mbo_utilities
```

To get the latest version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/MillerBrainObservatory/mbo_utilities.git@master
```

To utilize the GPU, you will need CUDA and an appropriate [cupy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html) installation.

By default, cupy for `CUDA 12.x` is installed.

Check which version of CUDA you have with `nvcc --version`.

```bash
nvcc --version
PS C:\Users\MBO-User\code> nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2025 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Wed_Jul_16_20:06:48_Pacific_Daylight_Time_2025
Cuda compilation tools, release 13.0, V13.0.48
Build cuda_13.0.r13.0/compiler.36260728_0
```

For CUDA 11.x and 13.x, you first need to uninstall 12x:

`pip uninstall cupy-cuda12x`

And replace `12` with the major CUDA version number, in this case `13`:

`pip install cupy-cuda13x`

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong PyTorch or CuPy version

``` bash
OSError: [WinError 1114] A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.
Error loading "path\to\.venv\Lib\site-packages\torch\lib\c10.dll" or one of its dependencies.
```

This error means you have the wrong version of pytorch install for your CUDA version.

You can run `uv pip uninstall torch` and `uv pip install torch --torch-backend=auto`.
If not using `uv`, follow instructions here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

``` bash
RuntimeError: CuPy failed to load nvrtc64_120_0.dll: FileNotFoundError: Could not find module 'nvrtc64_120_0.dll' (or one of its dependencies). Try using the full path with constructor syntax.
```

Having the wrong `cupy` version will lead to the following error message.
