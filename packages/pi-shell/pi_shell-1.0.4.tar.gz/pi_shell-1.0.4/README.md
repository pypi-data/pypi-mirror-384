# Pi Shell - Enhanced Raspberry Pi Management Tool

A CLI tool for managing multiple Raspberry Pi devices over SSH with automatic Pi detection through symlinks.

## üì¶ Installation

### Recommended: Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install pi-shell
```

### Alternative: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcyork/pi-shell.git
cd pi-shell

# Install using pip
pip install .

# Or install in editable mode for development
pip install -e .
```

This automatically installs all dependencies:
- `paramiko` - SSH library for Python
- `PyYAML` - YAML configuration file parser
- `cryptography` - For SSH key generation

After installation, the `pi-shell` command will be available globally.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: SSH Key Authentication (Recommended)

1.  **Configure a Pi with automatic key setup:**
    ```bash
    pi-shell add pi1 --host 192.168.1.10 --user pi --password raspberry --push-key
    ```
    This will:
    - Generate an SSH key pair at `~/.ssh/pi-shell` (if it doesn't exist)
    - Push the public key to the Pi for password-less authentication
    - Save the configuration to `~/.config/pi-shell/config.yml` with the key path
    
    **Benefits:** No passwords stored in config, more secure, no password prompts!

### Option 2: Password Authentication

1.  **Configure a Pi with password:**
    ```bash
    pi-shell add pi1 --host 192.168.1.10 --user pi --password raspberry
    ```
    This saves the Pi configuration to `~/.config/pi-shell/config.yml`.
    
    **Note:** Password will be stored in plain text in the config file.

2.  **Check its status:**
    ```bash
    pi-shell status pi1
    ```

3.  **Run a command:**
    ```bash
    # Using the --pi flag
    pi-shell run "uname -a" --pi pi1
    
    # Or if pi1 is set as default
    pi-shell run "uname -a"
    ```

## üîß Available Commands

The tool is organized into sub-commands for different actions.

### Core Actions (`run`, `read`, `write`)

These commands perform actions on a target Pi.

-   `run <command>`: Execute a shell command.
-   `run-stream <command>`: Stream output from a long-running command.
-   `read <remote_path>`: Read a file from the Pi.
-   `write <remote_path> <content>`: Write content to a file.

**Example:**
```bash
# Reboot pi2
./pi2 run "sudo reboot"

# Read the hostname from the default pi
./pi-shell read "/etc/hostname"
```

### Management Actions (`add`, `remove`, `list`, `status`, `set-default`)

These commands help you manage your list of Pis.

-   `add <name> --host <host> --user <user> --password <password> [--push-key]`: Add a new Pi. Creates a symlink.
    - Use `--push-key` to automatically set up SSH key authentication (recommended - password used once to push key, then not stored)
    - Without `--push-key`, password is stored in config for ongoing authentication (less secure)
-   `remove <name>`: Remove a Pi. Deletes the symlink.
-   `list`: Show all configured Pis in a table.
-   `set-default <name>`: Set the default Pi for commands.
-   `status [name]`: Check connectivity and get the hostname for one or all Pis.

**Example:**
```bash
# See all configured Pis
./pi-shell list

# Check if all Pis are online
./pi-shell status

# Add a new Pi named 'pi-hole' with SSH key authentication (recommended)
./pi-shell add pi-hole --host 192.168.1.20 --user admin --password raspberry --push-key

# Or add with password authentication only
./pi-shell add pi-hole --host 192.168.1.20 --user admin --password raspberry

# Set it as the default
./pi-shell set-default pi-hole
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Device details are stored in `~/.config/pi-shell/config.yml` (per-user). While you can edit it manually, it's recommended to use the `add` and `remove` commands.

**Note:** 
- Each user has their own config in their home directory (`~/.config/pi-shell/config.yml`)
- This works with system-wide installations - no conflicts between users!
- You can mix and match authentication methods - some Pis can use SSH keys while others use passwords

### Example:
```yaml
pi1:
  host: 192.168.1.10
  user: pi
  key: ~/.ssh/pi-shell  # SSH key authentication (recommended)
pi2:
  host: 192.168.1.20
  user: pi
  password: raspberry  # Password authentication
default: pi1
```

## üîë SSH Key Authentication

The tool can automatically set up SSH key-based authentication, which is more secure and convenient than passwords.

### How It Works:
1. When you use `--push-key` with the `add` command, the tool:
   - Generates an ED25519 SSH key pair at `~/.ssh/pi-shell` (if it doesn't exist)
   - Connects to the Pi using the provided password (one time only)
   - Copies the public key to the Pi's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
   - Saves the key path in `config.yml`

2. All future connections use the SSH key automatically - no password needed!

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **More Secure:** No passwords stored in plain text
- ‚úÖ **Convenient:** No password prompts during operations
- ‚úÖ **One Key for All:** Same key can be used for all your Pis
- ‚úÖ **LLM-Friendly:** No interactive password prompts when used by AI assistants

### Manual Key Setup:
If you prefer to use your own SSH key:
```bash
./pi-shell add pi1 --host 192.168.1.10 --user pi --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## üéØ How It Works

The tool determines which Pi to connect to in the following order of priority:
1.  The `--pi <name>` command-line argument.
2.  The name of the symlink used to execute the script (e.g., `./pi1`).
3.  The `default` entry in `config.yml`.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

-   **Connection Errors:** Use `./pi-shell status` to check connectivity. Ensure the host IP is correct and the device is on the network.
-   **Host Key Errors:** If you see a "BadHostKeyException", it means the Pi's SSH key has changed (e.g., after an OS reinstall). The tool will provide you with the correct `ssh-keygen -R <host>` command to run to fix it.
-   **Authentication Errors:** If you don't store a password in the config, the tool will prompt you for one. For non-interactive use, consider setting up SSH key-based authentication and providing the key path in `config.yml`.

## üìã Requirements

-   Python 3.6+
-   paramiko (SSH library)
-   PyYAML
-   SSH access to your Raspberry Pis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

**Password Security:**
- Passwords stored in `config.yml` are **not encrypted**. They are saved in plain text.
- This tool is designed for development environments with Raspberry Pis, typically using default passwords like "raspberry".
- If you plan to use this tool with production Linux machines or systems with sensitive credentials, be aware that there is no encryption on the YAML configuration file.
- For better security in production environments, consider using SSH key-based authentication instead (use the `--key` parameter when adding a Pi).

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling

To uninstall pi-shell:

```bash
pip uninstall pi-shell
```

**Note:** This removes the command but preserves your data:
- Config: `~/.config/pi-shell/config.yml`
- SSH keys: `~/.ssh/pi-shell`
- Symlinks: `/usr/local/bin/keybird`, etc.

For complete removal instructions, see [docs/UNINSTALL.md](docs/UNINSTALL.md)
