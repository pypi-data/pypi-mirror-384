## Overview

`disco-data-logger` provides a **fast, compressed, and lightweight data recording layer**  
for large-scale **Disco** simulations and other computational experiments.  

It is optimized for capturing **sparse numerical state updates** and **accumulators** during simulation runs,  
and writing them efficiently to disk as **Zstandard-compressed segment files**.  
Each simulation entity or measurement can log its data independently through labeled streams.

It combines:
- A **C++/pybind11 core** for high-throughput buffering and compression.
- **Python API** for easy stream registration and control.
- Optional **Parquet export** for analysis and aggregation after runs.

## ✨ Features

- **Sparse vector logging** with index/value arrays (`uint32`, `float64`).
- **Fixed-point quantization** for compact and deterministic encoding.
- **Buffered, lock-free write path** (ring buffer + writer thread).
- **Zstandard compression** (vendored, no external dependencies).
- **Segment rotation** for large simulation outputs.
- **JSON metadata** for each stream (`organisation`, `model`, `experiment`, …).
- **Optional Parquet export** for post-run analytics.
- **MIT-licensed** and designed for in-cluster (on-disk/in-memory) use.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install disco-data-logger
```

For Parquet export support:

```bash
pip install "disco-data-logger[parquet]"
```
