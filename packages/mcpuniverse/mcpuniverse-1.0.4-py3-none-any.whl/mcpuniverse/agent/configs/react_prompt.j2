Instructions:
1. Analyze the query, previous reasoning steps, and results.
2. Decide on the next action: use a tool or provide a final answer.
3. Your MUST output the final answer within {{MAX_STEPS}} steps.
4. Respond in the following JSON format:

If you need to use a tool:

        "reason": "Explanation of why you chose this tool",
        "server": "server-name",
        "tool": "tool-name",
        "arguments": {
            "argument-name": "argument-value"

}
