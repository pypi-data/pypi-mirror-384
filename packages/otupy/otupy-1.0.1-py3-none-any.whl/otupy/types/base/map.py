		Implements OpenC2 Map:
		>An unordered map from a set of specified keys to values with semantics 
			bound to each key. Each field has an id, name and type.

		However, the id is not considered in this implementation.

		The implementation follows a similar logic than `Array`. Each derived class
		is expected to provide a `fieldtypes` class attribute that associate field names 
		with their class definition. 
		
		Additionally, according to the Language Specification, `Map`s may be extended by
		Profiles. Such extensions must use the `base` and `register` class attributes to 
		bind to the base element they extend and the `Profile` in which they are defined.

		For derived types that are recursive (i.e., they need to hold an instance of their same
		type internally), declare the type of the recursive field as `typing.Self`, and 
		use the `@make_recursive` decorator in front of the class definition.
		(See also (recursive definitions)[https://github.com/mattereppe/otupy/blob/main/docs/developingextensions.md#recursive-definitions] in the documentation)
