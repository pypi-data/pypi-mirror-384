		Note that the current implementation requires all possible choices to be of different types. 
		Due to this limitation, it is not currently possible to define, e.g., more than an object of
		type `str`. In such a case, distinct data types must be defined and used for the `str` objects.
		This limitation should have limited impact, since the `Choice`  is expected to be used
		to select between different data types.
