		""" Builds the `MQTTTransfer` instance

			The `broker` and `port` parameters are used to select theh MQTT Broker.
			This implementation only supports TCP as transport protocol.

			The topics to be subscribed or used for publishing will be automatically derived.
			If no `device_id` is provided, the device-specific topic will not be subscribed.
			The Specification does not cover the generation of device identifiers (Sec. 2.2); additionally,
			it is not clear why the Consumer's topic is denoted as `device_id` while the Producer's topic as
			`producer_id`. This implementation uses the same identifiers already present in the `Message` metadata
			(namely, `From` and `To` fields) (Sec. 2.4.2). Note that both Consumers and Producers are expected to
			*always* include their identifiers in the `From` field (Sec. 2.4.2), so this argument is mandatory
			for the MQTT transfer.

			According to Sec. 3.1.8:
			- Consumer SHALL subscribe to topics for all actuator devices, all-commands topic, individual topic for device
			- Producer SHALL subscribe to the general response topic
			- Producer SHOULD subscribe to their individual topic
			Therefore, 
			1) the `profiles` and `device_id` arguments are mandatory for Consumers;
			2) the `device_id` could be optional for Producers, but it is mandatory in this implementation because of the above requirement on the `From` field.
			This implementation will always subscribe all topics for Consumers/Producers.
			
			For sending data, the `send()` method will wait at most `response_timeout` secodns before returning. 
			In case the Commands are sent to specific devices, it will return as soon as all of them have answered.
			If the Command is broadcast to all APs or to all devices, it will return after the above timeout. The
			same will happen if the message is sent to specific devices, but they do not include their identifier in 
			the `Message.from` field, as required by the standard.

			For receiving data, the `receive()` method will keep MQTT message for at least `response_timeout`  seconds
			for detecting and discarding duplicates. Duplicates received after `response_timeout` seconds are not 
			guaranteed to be correctly detected as such.

			:param broker: Hostname or IP address of the MQTT Broker
			:param port: Transport port of the MQTT Broker
			:param device_id: OpenC2 device identifier to be used in topic name for the specific actuator (mandatory)
			:param profiles: list of profile names for actuators running on the Consumer (will be ignored by the Producer)
			:param username: Username to connect to MQTT broker
			:param password: Password to connect to MQTT broker
			:param client_id: Client identifier to connect to MQTT broker
			:param response_timeout: Timeout to wait for responses to commands from multiple devices (for Producers). 
			 							Timeout to detect duplicates of commands from multiple topics (for Consumers).
			:param usessl: Enable (`True`) or disable (`False`) SSL. Internal use only. Do not set this argument,
