""" IPv6 Address

	This module implements an IPv6 Address as described in Sec. 3.4.2.9.

The usage of the ipaddress module is compliant to what required in the
language specification for IPv6 addresses, especially the following points:
a) The IPv6 address should be available both in string and binary form
b) The network representation is an array according to RFC 4291 Sec. 2.3
   (host/prefix, host/mask, host/hostmask, etc.)
