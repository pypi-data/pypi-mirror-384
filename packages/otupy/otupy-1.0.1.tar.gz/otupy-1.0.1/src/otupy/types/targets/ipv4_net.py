		IPv4 Address Range as defined in Sec. 3.4.1.9.

		The Standard is not clear on this part. The 
		IPv4Net Target is defined as "Array /ipv4-net"
		(where ipv4-net --lowercase!-- is never defined!)
		However, the json serialization requirements explicitely
		define:
		Array /ipv4-net: JSON string containing the text representation 
		 						of an IPv4 address range as specified in 
		 						[RFC4632], Section 3.1.
		According to this definition, I assume a single network address
		should be managed. Extension to an array of IP network addresses
		is rather straightforward by using a list for ipv4_net attribute.
		Note that I have to keep both the string representation of the
		network address as well as the IPv4Network object to easily 
		manage the code and to automate the creation of the dictionary.
