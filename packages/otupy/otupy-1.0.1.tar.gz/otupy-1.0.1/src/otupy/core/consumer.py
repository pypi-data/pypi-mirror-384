		The `Consumer` is designed to dispatch OpenC2 `Message`s to the relevant `Actuator`. 
		The current implementation receives the configuration at initialization time. It is therefore
		not conceived to be runned itself as a service, but to be integrated in an external component 
		that reads the relevant configuration from file and passes it to the Consumer.

		The `Consumer` has two main tasks:
		- creating the OpenC2 stack to process Messages (namely the combination of an Encoding format and
				a Transfer protocol);
		- dispatching incoming `Command`s to the relevant `Actuator`.

		Each `Consumer` will only run a single `Transfer` protocol. All registered `Encoder`s can be used,
		and a default `Encoder` is explicitely given that will be used when no other selection is available 
		(e.g., to answer Messages that the Consumer does not understand).
