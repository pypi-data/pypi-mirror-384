# Context Discovery Actuator Profile

## 1. Goals of Context Discovery

To fill the gap left by the OpenC2 specifications, a new Actuator Profile has been introduced with the goal to abstract the services that are running into the network, the interactions between them and the security features that they implement. Identifying a service involves determining its type and the specific characteristics of that type. The service also provides essential information, such as hostname, encoding format, and transfer protocol, for connecting to it and to any linked services. In this way, the context in which the service is operating is identified. This new Actuator Profile has been named “Context Discovery”, herein referred as CTXD, with the nsid “ctxd”.

The Context Discovery employs a recursive function to achieve this task, querying each digital resource to determine its features. Thus, once the Producer has obtained from the Consumer the information on how to connect to the digital resources linked to the Consumer, it will query each new digital resource to determine its features, thereby producing a map.

The Context Discovery profile is implemented on the Consumer side and is one of the possible Actuator Profiles that the Consumer can support. Communication follows the OpenC2 standard, where a Producer sends a Command specifying that the Actuator to execute it is CTXD. If the Consumer implements CTXD, it will return a Response.

## 2. Data model

A data model is implemented to define which data the CTXD stores and the relationship between them. The most important data stored are:

- **Service:** It is the main class of the data model, and it describes the environment where the service is located, its links to other services, its subservices, the owner, the release, the security functions, and the actuator.
- **Service-Type:** This class identifies the specific type of service. Each instance has its own parameters, and the Service has only one type. Examples: VM, Container, Cloud, etc.
- **Link:** This class describes the connection between the services. The field “peers” specifies the services that are on the other side of the link, so this class is useful for recursive discovery. Also, security functions applied on the link are specified and they are described as OpenC2 Actuator Profiles.
- **Consumer:** It manages information about various services, including the security functions that protect them.
- **OpenC2-Endpoint:** They are described in the OpenC2-Endpoint class and correspond to both the OpenC2 Actuator Profile and the endpoint that implements it. A service can implement multiple security functions.
- **Peer:** This class describes the service that is connected to the service under analysis.

## 3. Command Components

This section identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

- **Action:** List of Actions that are relevant for the CTXD. This Profile cannot define Actions that are not included in the OpenC2 Language Specification, but it may extend their definitions.
- **Target:** List of Targets included in the Language Specification and one Target (and its associated Specifiers) that is defined only for the CTXD.
- **Arguments:** List of Command Arguments that are relevant for the CTXD.
- **Actuator:** List of Actuator Specifiers that are relevant for the CTXD.

### 3.1 Actions

Action is a mandatory field in Command message and no Actuator Profile can add a new Action that is not present in the specifications.

Type: Action (Enumerated)

| ID  | Name    | Description                       |
| --- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| 3   | query   | Initiate a request for information. |

### 3.2 Target

Target is a mandatory field in Command message, and it is possible to define new Targets that are not present in the specifications. Only one Target is allowed in a Command, and that’s why the cardinality of each one equals to 1.

Type: Target (Choice)

| ID    | Name    | Type    | #  | Description                                                                   |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9     | features| Features| 1   | A set of items used with the query Action to determine an Actuator’s capabilities. |
| 2048  | context | Context | 1   | It describes the service environment, its connections and security capabilities. |

A new target, called “context” is inserted because the Target “features” refers only to the Actuator capabilities and not to the characteristics of the execution environment.

### 3.3 Context

Type: Context (Record)

| ID  | Name    | Type             | #    | Description                                           |
| --- | ------- | ---------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | services| ArrayOf(Name)    | 0..1 | List the service names that the command refers to.    |
| 2   | links   | ArrayOf(Name)    | 0..1 | List the link names that the command refers to.       |

The Target Context is used when the Producer wants to know the information of all active services and links of the Consumer. The Producer can specify the names of the services and links it is interested in.

### Usage Requirements

- Producer may send a “query” Command with no fields to the Consumer, which could return a heartbeat to this command.
- A Producer may send a “query” Command containing an empty list of services. The Consumer should return all the services.
- A Producer may send a “query” Command containing an empty list of links. The Consumer should return all the links.
- A Producer may send a “query” Command containing an empty list of services and links. The Consumer should return all the services and links.

### 3.4 Command Arguments

Type: Args (Map)

| ID    | Name              | Type           | #    | Description                                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | response_requested | Response-Type  | 0..1 | The type of Response required for the Command: none, ack, status, complete.  |
| 2048  | name_only          | Boolean        | 0..1 | The response includes either only the name or all the details about the services and the links. |

Command Arguments are optional, and a new one called “name_only” has been defined, which is not present in the Language Specification.

### Usage requirements:

- The "response_requested": "complete" argument can be present in the "query features" Command. (Language specification 4.1)
- The “query context” Command may include the "response_requested": "complete" Argument.
- The “query context” command may include the “name_only” argument:
  - If TRUE, the Consumer must send a Response containing only the names of the services and/or links.
  - If FALSE, the Consumer must send a Response containing all the details of the services and/or links.

### 3.5 Actuator Specifiers

List of Actuators Specifiers that are applicable to the Actuator. This is an optional field. These specifiers are not present in the Language Specification.

Type: Specifiers (Map)

| ID  | Name     | Type   | #    | Description                                    |
| --- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | domain   | String | 0..1 | Domain under the responsibility of the actuator |
| 2   | asset_id | String | 0..1 | Identifier of the actuator                    |

## 5 CTXD data types
