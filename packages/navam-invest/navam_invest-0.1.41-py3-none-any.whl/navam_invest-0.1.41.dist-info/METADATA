## ✨ Key Features

### 🔀 Automatic Intent-Based Routing (v0.1.36+)

**No more manual agent switching!** Just ask your question naturally:

```bash
navam invest

# Simply ask - the router automatically selects the right agent(s)
> Should I invest in AAPL?
# → Router analyzes intent
# → Routes to Quill (fundamentals) + Macro Lens (timing) + Risk Shield (exposure)
# → Synthesizes comprehensive recommendation

> Find undervalued tech stocks with strong earnings momentum
# → Router detects screening + earnings intent
# → Routes to Screen Forge + Earnings Whisperer

> Protect my NVDA position with options
# → Router detects hedging intent
# → Routes to Hedge Smith for options strategies
```

**Power users** can still use manual commands (`/quill`, `/hedge`, `/risk`) for direct agent control.

### Multi-Agent Investment Analysis

**Command**: `/analyze <SYMBOL>` or just ask naturally

1. **Quill** performs bottom-up fundamental analysis
2. **News Sentry** checks for material events and insider trading
3. **Macro Lens** validates with top-down economic context
4. **Risk Shield** assesses portfolio fit and concentration risks
5. **Tax Scout** evaluates tax implications and timing
6. **Synthesis** combines all perspectives into final recommendation

- Revenue +15% YoY, 42% gross margin, $87B FCF

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL SYNTHESIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: BUY (Dollar-Cost Average)
📊 Confidence Level: MEDIUM

**Key Reasoning**:

Microsoft shows exceptional fundamental quality:
- 42% ROE, $87B annual FCF (best-in-class capital efficiency)
- Strong competitive moats (Azure cloud, enterprise software lock-in)
- Consistent earnings beats (+4.2% avg surprise, 4 quarters)
- 89% analyst buy ratings, $475 mean target (+13% upside)

However, macro timing suggests staged entry:
- Late expansion phase (GDP slowing from 2.8% to 2.4%)
- Inverted yield curve (-0.54%) signals 70% recession probability
- Tech sector vulnerable (Nasdaq -8% from highs)

**Suggested Action**:

Dollar-cost average over 3-6 months:
- Tranche 1: 40% now (defensive exposure to quality)
- Tranche 2: 30% if MSFT dips below $390 (-7% from current)
- Tranche 3: 30% if macro deteriorates (recession confirmed)

    → get_sector_etf_alternatives

**REPLACEMENT STRATEGY: GOOGL**

Option 1: Sector ETF Substitute (RECOMMENDED)
- Ticker: XLK - Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF
- Correlation: 0.75 (wash-sale compliant)
- Investment: $120 × shares (match original position size)
- Hold for: 31+ days, then repurchase GOOGL if desired
- Tracking: Expected 75% correlation during hold period

Option 2: Synthetic Long (Options)
- Buy 1 call contract @ $120 strike, 60-day expiration
- Sell 1 put contract @ $120 strike, 60-day expiration
- Net cost: ~$2.50 per share ($250 per contract)
- Delta: ~1.0 (matches stock exposure)
- Expiration: Allows repurchase of stock after 31 days

**RECOMMENDATION**: Sector ETF substitute (XLK) for simplicity

**REPLACEMENT STRATEGY: ETHUSD**

Option 1: Execute sell + immediate rebuy (RECOMMENDED)
- Crypto exempt from wash-sale rules (IRS Notice 2014-21)
- Harvest loss: -$700 tax deduction
- Rebuy immediately: Maintain same exposure with zero gap
- Tax Benefit: Pure tax savings with no disruption

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL TAX OPTIMIZATION PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (Execute today):

1. Sell GOOGL @ market
   → Replace with XLK (Tech ETF) for 31+ days
   → Tax savings: $6,000 | Hold ETF 31+ days

2. Sell ETHUSD @ market
   → Rebuy immediately (crypto exempt from wash-sale)
   → Tax savings: $259 | Maintain same exposure

**TOTAL TAX IMPACT**:
- Total harvestable losses: -$6,259
- Estimated tax savings: $6,259
- Cost of replacement: $0 (ETF fees negligible, crypto rebuy instant)

- [ ] Maintain similar portfolio allocation and risk profile
- [ ] Document cost basis and trade dates for tax reporting
- [ ] Set 31-day calendar reminder to avoid repurchase violations
