**No more manual agent switching!** Just ask your question naturally:

```bash

> Find undervalued tech stocks with strong earnings momentum
# → Router detects screening + earnings intent
# → Routes to Screen Forge + Earnings Whisperer

> Protect my NVDA position with options
# → Router detects hedging intent
# → Routes to Hedge Smith for options strategies
```

**Power users** can still use manual commands (`/quill`, `/hedge`, `/risk`) for direct agent control.

FINAL SYNTHESIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: BUY (Dollar-Cost Average)
📊 Confidence Level: MEDIUM

**Key Reasoning**:

Microsoft shows exceptional fundamental quality:
- 42% ROE, $87B annual FCF (best-in-class capital efficiency)
- Strong competitive moats (Azure cloud, enterprise software lock-in)
- Consistent earnings beats (+4.2% avg surprise, 4 quarters)
- 89% analyst buy ratings, $475 mean target (+13% upside)

However, macro timing suggests staged entry:
- Late expansion phase (GDP slowing from 2.8% to 2.4%)
- Inverted yield curve (-0.54%) signals 70% recession probability
- Tech sector vulnerable (Nasdaq -8% from highs)

**Suggested Action**:

Dollar-cost average over 3-6 months:
- Tranche 1: 40% now (defensive exposure to quality)
- Tranche 2: 30% if MSFT dips below $390 (-7% from current)
- Tranche 3: 30% if macro deteriorates (recession confirmed)

Microsoft's defensive characteristics position it to outperform
cyclical tech peers in downturn.

**Risk Warnings**:
1. Azure growth deceleration below 25% YoY would weaken thesis
2. Recession could compress P/E to 24-26x (15-20% downside)
3. If yield curve steepens rapidly, pause accumulation

    → calculate_correlation
    → assess_sector_concentration

**Position Sizing Recommendations**:
- **VZ**: 5-7% allocation (defensive core holding)
- **MO**: 2-3% allocation (higher risk, satellite position)
- **T**: 3-5% allocation (value/turnaround play)

**Concentration Risk**: MODERATE
- 10-15% combined telecom exposure acceptable
- Provides defensive characteristics, recession hedge
- Low correlation with tech-heavy portfolios

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**#1 BEST: Verizon (VZ) - BUY**
- Entry: $38-40 range
- Target yield: 6.5-7.0%
- Position size: 5-7% of portfolio
- Thesis: Infrastructure moat + recession-resistant + attractive valuation

**#2 HOLD: Altria (MO) - Monitor**
- Entry: Below $42 (current $43.20)
- Target yield: 8%+
- Position size: 2-3% maximum (satellite)
- Thesis: High yield but declining business, payout risk

**#3 HOLD: AT&T (T) - Turnaround Play**
- Entry: $15-17 range
- Target yield: 6-7%
- Position size: 3-5%
- Thesis: Post-cut stabilization, fiber buildout upside

**Action Steps**:
1. Start with VZ (5% allocation) for defensive income core
2. Watch for MO dip below $42 for small satellite position
3. Monitor AT&T fiber subscriber growth for entry signal
