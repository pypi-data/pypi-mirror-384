üéØ RECOMMENDATION: BUY (Dollar-Cost Average)
üìä Confidence Level: MEDIUM

**Key Reasoning**:

Microsoft shows exceptional fundamental quality:
- 42% ROE, $87B annual FCF (best-in-class capital efficiency)
- Strong competitive moats (Azure cloud, enterprise software lock-in)
- Consistent earnings beats (+4.2% avg surprise, 4 quarters)
- 89% analyst buy ratings, $475 mean target (+13% upside)

However, macro timing suggests staged entry:
- Late expansion phase (GDP slowing from 2.8% to 2.4%)
- Inverted yield curve (-0.54%) signals 70% recession probability
- Tech sector vulnerable (Nasdaq -8% from highs)

**Suggested Action**:

Dollar-cost average over 3-6 months:
- Tranche 1: 40% now (defensive exposure to quality)
- Tranche 2: 30% if MSFT dips below $390 (-7% from current)
- Tranche 3: 30% if macro deteriorates (recession confirmed)
