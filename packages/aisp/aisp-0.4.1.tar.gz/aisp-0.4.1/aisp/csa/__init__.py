"""Module (CSA) Clonal Selection Algorithm.

CSAs are inspired by the process of antibody proliferation upon detecting an antigen, during which
the generated antibodies undergo mutations in an attempt to enhance pathogen recognition.

Classes
-------
AIRS : Artificial Immune Recognition System.
    A supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks based on the clonal
    selection principle.
Clonalg : Clonal Selection Algorithm.
    Implementation of the clonal selection algorithm for optimization, adapted
    for both minimization and maximization of cost functions in binary,
    continuous, and permutation problems.
