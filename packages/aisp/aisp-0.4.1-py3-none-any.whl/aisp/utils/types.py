Type Aliases
------------
FeatureType : Literal["binary-features", "continuous-features", "ranged-features"]
    Specifies the type of features in the input data. Can be one of:
    - "binary-features": Features with binary values (e.g., 0 or 1).
    - "continuous-features": Features with continuous numeric values.
    - "ranged-features": Features represented by ranges or intervals.
FeatureTypeAll : Literal["binary-features", "continuous-features", "ranged-features"]
    Specifies the type of features in the input data. Can be one of:
    - "binary-features": Features with binary values (e.g., 0 or 1).
    - "continuous-features": Features with continuous numeric values.
    - "ranged-features": Features represented by ranges or intervals.
    - "permutation-features": Features represented by permutation.

MetricType : Literal["manhattan", "minkowski", "euclidean"]
    Specifies the distance metric to use for calculations. Possible values:
    - "manhattan": The calculation of the distance is given by the expression:
            √( (x₁ - x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)² + ... + (yn - yn)²).
    - "minkowski": The calculation of the distance is given by the expression:
            ( |X₁ - Y₁|p + |X₂ - Y₂|p + ... + |Xn - Yn|p) ¹/ₚ.
    - "euclidean": The calculation of the distance is given by the expression:
            ( |x₁ - x₂| + |y₁ - y₂| + ... + |yn - yn|).
