**********************************
v1.1 - WCS Coordinate Improvements
**********************************

This release includes changes to the models and helper functions which are used to generate the gWCS coordinates when reading ASDF files.

In addition to this some internal changes were made to support the asdf 3.0 release.

When new ASDF files are generated by the DKIST data center this release will be required to make use of these improved files.
