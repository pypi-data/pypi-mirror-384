1. Run the pre-release workflow on GitHub actions, this can be done by clicking "run workflow" `here <https://github.com/DKISTDC/dkist/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yml>`__.
2. That workflow will have opened a PR, you should review it and merge it as normal.
3. That workflow will also have drafted a GitHub release `here <https://github.com/DKISTDC/dkist/releases>`__, once the PR is merged you can publish that release, this will trigger the rest as long as the CI passes.
