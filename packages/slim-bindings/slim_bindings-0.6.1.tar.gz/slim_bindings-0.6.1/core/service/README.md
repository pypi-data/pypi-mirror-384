The `agntcy-slim-service` module provides the high-level API and session
management layer for Agntcy SLIM applications. It serves as the main entry point for
integrating with the SLIM data plane, offering abstractions for various
communication patterns and session management.

## Overview

This module bridges application logic with the underlying SLIM data plane,
providing:

- High-level interface for applications to interact with SLIM
- Session management for different communication patterns
- Connection establishment and management
- Message sending and receiving logic
- Routing configuration for messaging patterns

The service layer translates application-level operations into the appropriate
network-level operations handled by the datapath module.
