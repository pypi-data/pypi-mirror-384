The `agntcy-slim-datapath` module serves as the foundation of the Agntcy SLIM
communication system, providing the core networking infrastructure for message
routing, connection management, and multiple communication patterns.

## Overview

handling the low-level transport and routing mechanisms. It implements several
key features:

- Message routing based on 4 tuple identifiers
- Connection management for reliable communication
- Flexible subscription model for dynamic service discovery
- Protocol buffer-based message serialization
- Multiple session patterns
- Support for message retransmission and reliability mechanisms
- Connection pooling and resource management
