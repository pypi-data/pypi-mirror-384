# ESGProfiler

**Automated ESG scoring and profiling for companies using Python and NLP.**

ESGProfiler is an open-source Python package and interactive Streamlit dashboard to help investors, analysts, and researchers quantitatively assess the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) footprint of any companyâ€”based on public filings, news, and reports.

- ðŸ“Š **Automated ESG scoring**
    - Extract ESG metrics from text (filings, reports, news)
    - Compute subscores (Environment, Social, Governance) and composite ESG ratings
- ðŸ“° **Data sourcing**
    - Ingest from Yahoo Finance, SEC filings, news headlines, report URLs, or pasted text
- ðŸ’¬ **NLP-driven analysis**
    - Keyword analysis and key sentence extraction with spaCy & transformers
- ðŸ“ˆ **Streamlit dashboard**
    - Interactive, visual results. Upload documents, analyze companies, and compare ESG ratings.
- âš¡ **Modular, extensible package**
    - Easy for researchers to extend scoring, NLP, or data sources
