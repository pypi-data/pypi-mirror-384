> This software is **Incubating** and subject to ECMWF's guidelines on [Software Maturity](https://github.com/ecmwf/codex/raw/refs/heads/main/Project%20Maturity).

**earthkit-hydro** is a Python library for common hydrological functions. It is the hydrological component of [earthkit](https://github.com/ecmwf/earthkit).

## Installation
For a default installation, run

```
pip install earthkit-hydro
```

*Developer instructions:*

For a developer setup (includes linting and test libraries), run

```
conda create -n hydro python=3.12
conda activate hydro
conda install -c conda-forge rust
git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/earthkit-hydro.git
cd earthkit-hydro
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```
Note: this project is a mixed Rust-Python project with a pure Python fallback. To handle this, the behaviour of the install is based on an environmental variable `USE_RUST`, with the following behaviour
- `Not set or any other value (default behaviour)`:
Attempts to build with Rust and if failure, skips and falls back to pure Python implementation.
- `USE_RUST=0`:
Builds pure Python implementation.
- `USE_RUST=1`:
Builds with Rust and fails if something goes wrong.
