Exporting
=========

Parslet can export your workflow's DAG for inspection or documentation.

``--export-dot <file>``
    Write the DAG to a Graphviz DOT file.  Use ``-`` as the file name to print
    the DOT text to ``stdout``.

``--export-png <file>``
    Render the DAG as a PNG image.  Requires ``pydot`` and Graphviz to be
    installed.

``parslet export --dag <file> <workflow.py>``
    Save the DAG structure to a JSON ``.dag`` file without executing the
    workflow. The resulting file can be run later with ``parslet run --dag``.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: bash

   parslet run examples/hello.py --export-png hello_dag.png

Both options may be used together.  Exporting does not affect the execution of
the workflow, so it can be enabled even on resourceâ€‘constrained machines.
The underlying conversion is handled by functions in ``parslet.core.exporter``
which build a ``pydot`` representation from the internal ``networkx`` graph.
See :doc:`cli` for all available flags.
