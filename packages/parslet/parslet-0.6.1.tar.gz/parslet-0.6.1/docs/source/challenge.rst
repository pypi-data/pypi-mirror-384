Our Parslet Showcase
====================

For our challenge submission, we're excited to introduce Parslet, our answer to a big problem: how can we empower developers everywhere, even if they don't have powerful laptops or reliable internet?

Parslet is a small, smart tool that lets you automate tasks on almost any device, even a phone. It's packed with features designed for the real world:
- It works completely **offline**.
- It has a **battery-saver mode** to keep you running longer.
- It has a **three-level DEFCON security system** to keep you safe.
- It's built to work perfectly in **Termux** on Android.
- It can even **translate** recipes from its "big brothers," Parsl and Dask.

We believe Parslet can be a bridge, connecting brilliant ideas to the tools needed to make them a reality, no matter the circumstances.
