## Usage

List of available utilities and their usage:

- tcutility.results | Read information from AMS calculations such as timings, settings, results, etc. from files in the calculation directory. Currently supports the ADF and DFTB engines.
- tcutility.molecule | Read and write rich xyz files. These are used to conveniently supply extra information with your xyz files, for example to let a program know what calculations to perform, or to include properties such as charge and spin-polarization.
- tcutility.analysis | Useful functions that are used for further analysis of calculation results. Currently includes vibrational mode checking to obtain or verify the reaction coordinate of an imaginary mode.
