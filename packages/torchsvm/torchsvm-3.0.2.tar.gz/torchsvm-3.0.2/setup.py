                   with exact leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) error computation. Conventional SVM solvers 
                   often face scalability and efficiency challenges, especially on large datasets or when multiple 
                   cross-validation runs are required. 
                   torchsvm computes LOOCV at the same cost as training a single SVM, while further boosting speed 
                   and scalability via CUDA-accelerated matrix operations. """,
