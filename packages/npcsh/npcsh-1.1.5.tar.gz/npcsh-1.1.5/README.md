# NPC Shell

The NPC shell is the toolkit for tomorrow, providing a suite of programs to make use of multi-modal LLMs and agents in novel interactive modes. `npcsh` is based in the command line, and so can be used wherever you work. 

- It is developed to work reliably with small models and performs excellently with the state-of-the-art models from major model providers. 
- Fundamentally, the core program of npcsh extends the familiar bash environment with an intelligent layer that lets users seamlessly ask agents questions, run pre-built or custom macros or agents, all without breaking the flow of command-line work.
- Switching between agents is a breeze in `npcsh`, letting you quickly and easily take advantage of a variety of agents (e.g. coding agents versus tool-calling agents versus prompt-based ReACT Flow agents) and personas (e.g. Data scientist, mapmaker with ennui, etc.).
- Project variables and context can be stored in team `.ctx` files. Personas (`.npc`) and Jinja execution templates (`.jinx`) are likewise stored in `yaml` within the global `npcsh` team or your project-specific one, letting you focus on adjusting and engineering context and system prompts iteratively so you can constantly improve your agent team's performance.

To get started:
```bash
# for users who want to mainly use models through APIs (e.g. , gemini, grok, deepseek, anthropic, openai, mistral, , any others provided by litellm ):
pip install 'npcsh[lite]' 
# for users who want to use local models (these install diffusers/transformers/torch stack so it is big.):
pip install 'npcsh[local]'
# for users who want to use the voice mode `yap`, see also the OS-specific installation instructions for installing needed system audio  libraries
pip install 'npcsh[yap]'
```
Once installed: run
```bash
npcsh
```
and you will enter the NPC shell. Additionally, the pip installation includes the following CLI tools available in bash: `corca`, `guac`, `npc` cli, `pti`, `spool`, `wander`, and`yap`. 


# Usage
  - Get help with a task: 
      ```bash
      npcsh>can you help me identify what process is listening on port 5337? 
      ```
      <p align="center"> 
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/test_data/port5337.png" alt="example of running npcsh to check what processes are listening on port 5337", width=600>
      </p>

  - Edit files
      ```bash
      npcsh>please read through the markdown files in the docs folder and suggest changes based on the current implementation in the src folder
      ```

  - **Ask a Generic Question**
    ```bash
    npcsh> has there ever been a better pasta shape than bucatini?
    ```
    ```                              
    Bucatini is certainly a favorite for many due to its unique hollow center, which holds sauces beautifully. Whether it's "better" is subjective and depends on the dish and personal        
    preference. Shapes like orecchiette, rigatoni, or trofie excel in different recipes. Bucatini stands out for its versatility and texture, making it a top contender among pasta shapes!    
    ```


  - **Search the Web**
    ```bash
    /search "cal golden bears football schedule" -sp perplexity
    ```
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/test_data/search_example.png" alt="example of search results", width=600>
     </p>

  - **Computer Use**
    ```bash
    /plonk 'find out the latest news on cnn'
    ```

  - **Generate Image**
    ```bash
    /vixynt 'generate an image of a rabbit eating ham in the brink of dawn' model='gpt-image-1' provider='openai'
    ```
      <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/test_data/rabbit.PNG" alt="a rabbit eating ham in the bring of dawn", width=250>
      </p>
  - **Generate Video**
    ```bash
    /roll 'generate a video of a hat riding a dog'
    ```
    <!--
      <p align="center">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/test_data/hat_video.mp4" alt="video of a hat riding a dog", width=250>
      </p> -->

  - **Serve an NPC Team**
    ```bash
    /serve --port 5337 --cors='http://localhost:5137/'
    ```
  - **Screenshot Analysis**: select an area on your screen and then send your question to the LLM
    ```bash
    /ots
    ```
  - **Use an mcp server**: make use of NPCs with MCP servers.
    ```bash
    /corca --mcp-server-path /path.to.server.py
    ```

  - **Build an NPC Team**: 

    ``` bash
    npc build flask --output ./dist --port 5337
    npc build docker --output ./deploy
    npc build cli --output ./bin
    npc build static --api_url https://api.example.com
    ```

# NPC Data Layer

The core of npcsh's capabilities is powered by the NPC Data Layer. Upon initialization, a user will be prompted to make a team in the current directory or to use a global team stored in `~/.npcsh/` which houses the NPC team with its jinxs, models, contexts, assembly lines. By implementing these components as simple data structures, users can focus on tweaking the relevant parts of their multi-agent systems.

## Creating Custom Components

Users can extend NPC capabilities through simple YAML files:

- **NPCs** (.npc): are defined with a name, primary directive, and optional model specifications
- **Jinxs** (.jinx): Jinja execution templates that provide function-like capabilities and scaleable extensibility through Jinja references to call other jinxs to build upon. Jinxs are executed through prompt-based flows, allowing them to be used by models regardless of their tool-calling capabilities, making it possible then to enable agents at the edge of computing through this simple methodology.
- **Context** (.ctx): Specify contextual information, team preferences, MCP server paths, database connections, and other environment variables that are loaded for the team or for specific agents (e.g. `GUAC_FORENPC`). Teams are specified by their path and the team name in the `<team>.ctx` file. Teams organize collections of NPCs with shared context and specify a coordinator within the team context who is used whenever the team is called upon for orchestration.

The NPC Shell system integrates the capabilities of `npcpy` to maintain conversation history, track command execution, and provide intelligent autocomplete through an extensible command routing system. State is preserved between sessions, allowing for continuous knowledge building over time.

This architecture enables users to build complex AI workflows while maintaining a simple, declarative syntax that abstracts away implementation complexity. By organizing AI capabilities in composable data structures rather than code, `npcsh` creates a more accessible and adaptable framework for AI automation that can scale more intentionally. Within teams can be subteams, and these sub-teams may be called upon for orchestration, but importantly, when the orchestrator is deciding between using one of its own team's NPCs versus yielding to a sub-team, they see only the descriptions of the subteams rather than the full persona descriptions for each of the sub-team's agents, making it easier for the orchestrator to better delineate and keep their attention focused by restricting the number of options in each decisino step. Thus, they may yield to the sub-team's orchestrator, letting them decide which sub-team NPC to use based on their own team's agents.

Importantly, users can switch easily between the NPCs they are chatting with by typing `/n npc_name` within the NPC shell. Likewise, they can create Jinxs and then use them from within the NPC shell by invoking the jinx name and the arguments required for the Jinx;  `/<jinx_name> arg1 arg2`

# Macros

## Startup Configuration and Project Structure
To initialize the NPC shell environment parameters correctly, first start the NPC shell:
```bash
npcsh
```
When initialized, `npcsh` will generate a `.npcshrc` file in your home directory that stores your npcsh settings.
Here is an example of what the `.npcshrc` file might look like after this has been run.
```bash
# NPCSH Configuration File
export NPCSH_INITIALIZED=1
export NPCSH_DB_PATH='~/npcsh_history.db'
export NPCSH_CHAT_MODEL=gemma3:4b
export NPCSH_CHAT_PROVIDER=ollama
export NPCSH_DEFAULT_MODE=agent
export NPCSH_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
export NPCSH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama
export NPCSH_IMAGE_GEN_MODEL=gpt-image-1
export NPCSH_IMAGE_GEN_PROVIDER=openai
export NPCSH_INITIALIZED=1
export NPCSH_REASONING_MODEL=deepseek-r1
export NPCSH_REASONING_PROVIDER=deepseek
export NPCSH_SEARCH_PROVIDER=duckduckgo
export NPCSH_STREAM_OUTPUT=1
export NPCSH_VECTOR_DB_PATH=~/npcsh_chroma.db
export NPCSH_VIDEO_GEN_MODEL=runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
export NPCSH_VIDEO_GEN_PROVIDER=diffusers
export NPCSH_VISION_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
export NPCSH_VISION_PROVIDER=openai
```

`npcsh` also comes with a set of jinxs and NPCs that are used in processing. It will generate a folder at `~/.npcsh/` that contains the tools and NPCs that are used in the shell and these will be used in the absence of other project-specific ones. Additionally, `npcsh` records interactions and compiled information about npcs within a local SQLite database at the path specified in the `.npcshrc `file. This will default to `~/npcsh_history.db` if not specified. When the data mode is used to load or analyze data in CSVs or PDFs, these data will be stored in the same database for future reference.

The installer will automatically add this file to your shell config, but if it does not do so successfully for whatever reason you can add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Source NPCSH configuration
if [ -f ~/.npcshrc ]; then
    . ~/.npcshrc
fi
```

We support inference via all providers supported by litellm. For openai-compatible providers that are not explicitly named in litellm, use simply `openai-like` as the provider. The default provider must be one of `['openai','anthropic','ollama', 'gemini', 'deepseek', 'openai-like']` and the model must be one available from those providers.

To use tools that require API keys, create an `.env` file in the folder where you are working or place relevant API keys as env variables in your `~/.npcshrc`. If you already have these API keys set in a `~/.bashrc` or a `~/.zshrc` or similar files, you need not additionally add them to `~/.npcshrc` or to an `.env` file. Here is an example of what an `.env` file might look like:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_deepseek_key'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_key'
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY='your_perplexity_key'
```


 Individual npcs can also be set to use different models and providers by setting the `model` and `provider` keys in the npc files.

 Once initialized and set up, you will find the following in your `~/.npcsh` directory:
```bash
~/.npcsh/
├── npc_team/           # Global NPCs
│   ├── jinxs/          # Global tools
│   └── assembly_lines/ # Workflow pipelines
│   └── sibiji.npc  # globally available npc 
│   └── npcsh.ctx  # global context file



```
For cases where you wish to set up a project specific set of NPCs, jinxs, and assembly lines, add a `npc_team` directory to your project and `npcsh` should be able to pick up on its presence, like so:
```bash
./npc_team/            # Project-specific NPCs
├── jinxs/             # Project jinxs #example jinx next
│   └── example.jinx
└── assembly_lines/    # Agentic Workflows
    └── example.line
└── models/    # Project workflows
    └── example.model
└── example1.npc        # Example NPC
└── example2.npc        # Example NPC
└── team.ctx            # Example ctx


```
