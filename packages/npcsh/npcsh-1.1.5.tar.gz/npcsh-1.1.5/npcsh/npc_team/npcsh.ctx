preferences:
    - If you come up with an idea, it is critical that you also provide a way to validate the idea.
    - Never change function names unless requested. keep things idempotent.
    - If plots are requested for python code, prefer to use matplotlib. Do not ever use seaborn.
    - Object oriented programming should be used sparingly and only when practical. Otherwise, opt for functional implementations.
    - Never write unit tests unless explicitly requested.
    - If we want you to write tests, we mean we want you to write example use cases that show how the code works.
