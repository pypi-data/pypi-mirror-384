class ImageMethod:
    r"""
    Image method for evaluating specular chains and specular suffixes candidates

    A specular chain (suffix) is a path (suffix) that consists only of specular
    reflections and refractions.

    This class processes the candidate specular suffixes and specular chains
    using the image method to compute valid paths from the candidates specular
    chains and suffixes. It consists in 5 steps:

    1. The depth at which the specular suffix starts is determined.
    This depth corresponds to the lowest depth from which the path consists only
    of specular reflections and refraction. For specular chains, this depth
    equals to one.

    2. The source of the specular suffix is determined. For specular chains, it
    is simply the source of the path. For specular suffixes, it is
    the intersection point preceding the specular suffix.

    4. Image computations: Images of the sources are computed by reflecting them
    on surfaces on which a specular reflection occurred. Refraction events
    are ignored during this step.

    5. Backtracking: Tracing is done backward from the targets to the sources,
    by spawning rays toward the images, first from the target, then from the
    intersection points of the rays with the scene. These intersection
    points are the final vertices of the paths for specular reflections and
    refractions. If intersections with other primitives than the ones computed
    during the candidates generation are found, then the paths are discarded,
    i.e., flagged as a non-valid candidate.
