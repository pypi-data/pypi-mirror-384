    Computes the channel coefficients and delays corresponding to traced paths

    The computation of the electric field is performed as follows:

        1. The electric field is initialized for every source from the antenna
    patterns.
        2. The electric field is "transported" by replaying the traced paths.
    At every interaction with the scene, the transfer matrix for this
    interaction is computed by evaluating the corresponding radio material, and
    the transfer matrix is applied to the transported electric field to update
    it.
        3. Once paths replay is over, the paths complex-valued coefficients are
    computed by taking the dot product between the transported electric field
    and the target antenna patterns.

    Note that the electric field is transported in the world implicit frame.
