        For a given radio map, ``num_pos`` random positions are sampled
        around each transmitter, such that the selected metric, e.g., SINR, is
        larger than ``min_val_db`` and/or smaller than ``max_val_db``.
        Similarly, ``min_dist`` and ``max_dist`` define the minimum and maximum
        distance of the random positions to the transmitter under consideration.
        By activating the flag ``tx_association``, only positions are sampled
        for which the selected metric is the highest across all transmitters.
        This is useful if one wants to ensure, e.g., that the sampled positions
        for each transmitter provide the highest SINR or RSS.

        Note that due to the quantization of the radio map into cells it is
        not guaranteed that all above parameters are exactly fulfilled for a
        returned position. This stems from the fact that every
        individual cell of the radio map describes the expected *average*
        behavior of the surface within this cell. For instance, it may happen
        that half of the selected cell is shadowed and, thus, no path to the
        transmitter exists but the average path gain is still larger than the
        given threshold. Please enable the flag ``center_pos`` to sample only
        positions from the cell centers.

        The above example shows an example for random positions between 50m and
        80m from the transmitter and a minimum path gain of -100 dB.
        Keep in mind that the transmitter can have a different height than the
        radio map which also contributes to this distance.
        For example if the transmitter is located 20m above the surface of the
        radio map and a ``min_dist`` of 20m is selected, also positions
        directly below the transmitter are sampled.
