science-search-test-30,what is the difference between law and theorem?,"Theorems are considered to be proven results derived from axioms, particularly those established in mathematical logic.  Axioms, on the other hand, are often referred to as laws, although the term ""law"" can also describe well-established theorems like the law of sines and cosines.","[[1], [1]]","Theorems are considered to be proven results derived from axioms, particularly those established in mathematical logic.

science-search-test-198,what is the difference between binary operation and binary relation?,"A binary operation is characterized as a function from $S\times S \to S$ such as addition, multiplication or anything really.
A binary relation, on the other hand, is just a subset of $S^2$, that is not necessarily a function.","[[1], [1]]","A binary operation is characterized as a function from $S\times S \to S$ such as addition, multiplication or anything really. [1]

science-forum-test-240,what's an intuitive way to think about the determinant?,"A determinant can be visualized as representing a volume.
The matrix's columns are thought of as vectors that originate from a skewed box, where the determinant is the volume of that box.
This is easily imagined in two dimensions with a rhombus, where the matrix's columns form its edges.
This concept helps us understand why the 'box' would be flattened if two columns are linearly dependent, and its volume would become zero.","[[1], [1], [1], [1]]","A determinant can be visualized as representing a volume. [1]

science-forum-test-270,how can you prove that a function has no closed form integral?,"The antiderivative of a function involving an exponential of another function can be represented with elementary functions if a particular equation involving a solution with a rational function is satisfied, as stated in Liouville's theorem, which was later revalidated using algebraic methods.
This procedural method for such determination is known as the Risch Algorithm, although it has complexities and is not a true algorithm, where the case of no antiderivative is particularly challenging.
For a deeper understanding, one can refer to Brian Conrad's work on impossibility theorems regarding integration in elementary terms.
Moreover, Differential Galois theory, a specialized area within Galois theory, allows us to prove that functions like sin(x)/x or x^x lack indefinite integrals.
Additionally, Liouville's theorem plays a crucial role in this area, and various literature can offer simple explanations of this theorem.
For the integration of elementary functions, specifically transcendental cases, there are straightforward techniques outlined, and Liouville's fundamental results on the structure of antiderivatives play a pivotal role.","[[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]","The antiderivative of a function involving an exponential of another function can be represented with elementary functions if a particular equation involving a solution with a rational function is satisfied, as stated in Liouville's theorem, which was later revalidated using algebraic methods.
