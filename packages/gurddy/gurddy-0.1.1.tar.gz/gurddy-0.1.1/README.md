### Gurddy
Gurddy is a lightweight Python package designed to model and solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Linear Programming (LP) problems with ease. Built for researchers, engineers, and optimization enthusiasts, Gurddy provides a unified interface to define variables, constraints, and objectivesâ€”then leverages powerful solvers under the hood to deliver optimal or feasible solutions.

Features
- ðŸ§© CSP Support: Define discrete variables, domains, and logical constraints.
- ðŸ“ˆ LP Support: Formulate linear objectives and inequality/equality constraints.
- ðŸ”Œ Extensible Solver Backend: Integrates with industry-standard solvers (e.g., Gurobi, CBC, or GLPK via compatible interfaces).
- ðŸ“¦ Simple API: Intuitive syntax for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
- ðŸ§ª Type-Hinted & Tested: Robust codebase with unit tests and clear documentation.
