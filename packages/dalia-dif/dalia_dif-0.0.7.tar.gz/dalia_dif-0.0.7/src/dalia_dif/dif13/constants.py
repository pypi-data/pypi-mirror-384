#: A single UUID to represent the resource under the ``dalia.oer`` prefix. Generate this UUID
#: yourself.
DIF_HEADER_ID = "DALIA_ID"
#: The SPDX license describing the upstream resource's terms and conditions. Dashes, spaces,
#: and capitalization are normalized.
#:
#: Warning: don't confuse this with the licensing of the metadata curated in the DIF, which
#: is licensed independently (we suggest CC0 for maximum reusability)
#:
#: This field also accepts the literal strings
#: ``proprietary`` or ``unlicensed``. For example, videos on YouTube are often licensed with
#: YouTube's proprietary license if the creator did not opt into using CC-BY-4.0.
DIF_HEADER_LICENSE = "License"
#: The URL link to the OER. Ideally, this is a DOI or other persistent identifier, but it can
#: be any URL that resolves
DIF_HEADER_LINK = "Link"
#: The language of the OER, written as an ISO two-letter code (e.g., `en` for English, `de`
#: for German)
DIF_HEADER_LANGUAGE = "Language"
#: The title of the resource. Please write this in the same language mentioned in the "Language"
#: column. If a colon `:` is present, the first one will be used to split the title into a title
#: and subtitle, which get put in different fields in DIF v1.3.
DIF_HEADER_TITLE = "Title"
#: A textual description of the resource. Please write this in the same language mentioned in the
#: "Language" column
DIF_HEADER_DESCRIPTION = "Description"
#: A list of authors, separated by asterisks. Each author should be written with family names, then
#: a comma, then given names. If an ORCID is available, then it can be added with a colon ``:``
#: then inside curly braces like in the following example.
#:
#: For example, `Kremer, Dominik : {https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1244-7363} * Geiger, Jonathan : {https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0452-7075}`
DIF_HEADER_AUTHORS = "Authors"
#: A list of UUIDs corresponding to pre-curated communities in DALIA. If you would like to request
#: a new one, please email charles.hoyt@ac.rwth-aachen.de.
DIF_HEADER_COMMUNITY = "Community"
#: The disciplines (e.g., chemistry, biology) covered by the resource encoded using
#: URIs from the DINI-KIM HochschulfÃ¤chersystematik resource, like
#: https://w3id.org/kim/hochschulfaechersystematik/n7.
#:
#: See https://w3id.org/kim/hcrt/scheme.html where you can search for the term and copy
#: the correct URI. When a discipline is missing from the resource, please either directly make an
#: issue on the upstream [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dini-ag-kim/hcrt) or email
#: charles.hoyt@ac.rwth-aachen.de for help
DIF_HEADER_DISCIPLINE = "Discipline"
#: A list of file extensions used by the resource (e.g., `.pdf`).
#: If multiple are available, please use an asterisk as a delimiter (e.g., `.pdf * .zip`).
DIF_HEADER_FILE_FORMAT = "FileFormat"
#: Free text keywords for the resource, delimited by an asterick (e.g.,
#: `digital humanities * culture`). Please write keywords in the same language
#: mentioned in the "Language" column
DIF_HEADER_KEYWORDS = "Keywords"
#: The learning resource type. Choose one of the keys in
#: :data:`dalia_dif.dif13.picklist.LEARNING_RESOURCE_TYPES`.
DIF_HEADER_LEARNING_RESOURCE_TYPE = "LearningResourceType"
#: The media type says what modality the learning resource has (e.g., audio, video, text).
#: This is a more broad category than learning resource type. Choose from
#: one of the keys in :data:`dalia_dif.dif13.picklist.MEDIA_TYPES`.
DIF_HEADER_MEDIA_TYPE = "MediaType"
#: One of the five proficiency levels described by the Dreyfus adaptive learning model
#: (https://doi.org/10.1177/02704676042649): novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, or
#: expert. These are encoded in :data:`dalia_dif.dif13.picklist.PROFICIENCY_LEVELS`
DIF_HEADER_PROFICIENCY_LEVEL = "ProficiencyLevel"
#: The date of publication, written in ISO standard format YYYY-MM-DD
DIF_HEADER_PUBLICATION_DATE = "PublicationDate"
#: The target audience (e.g., school students, bachelor's level students, data stewards, etc.).
#: Choose from the keys in :data:`dalia_dif.dif13.picklist.TARGET_GROUPS`.
DIF_HEADER_TARGET_GROUP = "TargetGroup"
#: Links to related works. These are curated as an asterisk-delimited list of predicate-value pairs
#: like: `isPartOf:https://doi.org/10.11588/heidicon/1738716` where the first part of the string is
#: a key from :data:`dalia_dif.dif13.picklist.RELATED_WORKS_RELATIONS` followed by a colon, then
#: the URL (ideally a DOI or other persistent identifier) to the target of the relation.
DIF_HEADER_RELATED_WORK = "RelatedWork"
#: The size, in megabytes (MB) of the file (e.g., `0.142`). Use a maximum of 3 places after the
#: decimal point. Do not write `MB`.
DIF_HEADER_SIZE = "Size"
#: The version of the OER. The same OER that is updated over time might have different versions,
#: each of which could be assigned their own record (and UUID) in DALIA.
DIF_HEADER_VERSION = "Version"
