## SQL Query: DNA extractions Benchling Warehouse (BWH)

This SQL query retrieves all the information of DNA extractions performed by the ToL Core Laboratory. 

The table produced also contains the eln_dna_extract_id and eln_file_registry_id 
which uniquely idenfied each dna extract entity in Benchling Warehouse (BWH). 

The eln_dna_extract_id should be used as the foreign key to the DNA extract entity the
submission is derived from.

Output: Table with cols: 

1) sts_id: [integer] Tissue metadata. Origin: STS
2) taxon_id: [character] Tissue metadata. Origin: STS
3) eln_tissue_id: [character] Benchling id for the tissue the extractions is derived from.
4) eln_tissue_prep_id: [character] Benchling id for the tissue prep the extractions is derived from.
5) eln_file_registry_id: [character] id in Benchling Registry.
6) eln_dna_extract_id: [character] Primary key. 
7) tolid: [character] Container barcode of the DNA fluidx tube. 
8) dna_extraction_date: [date] Extraction date. This field coalesces created_at$ and created_on fields. Created_on is for bnt legacy data.
9) eln_dna_extract_name: [character] Entity name. 
10) dna_fluidx_id: [character] Container barcode of the DNA fluidx tube. 
11) extractin_protocol: [character] Extraction protocol. 
12) dna_qc_passfail: [character] outcome of QC assessment duting decision making: pass=yes or fail=no.
13) dna_next_step: [jsonb] decision taken after extraction. 
14) dna_nanodrop_ngul: [double precision] nanodrop concentration in ng/ul.
15) dna_260_280_ratio: [double precision] nanodrop 260/280 ratio.
16) dna_260_230_ratio: [double precision] nanodrop 260/230 ratio.
17) dna_qubit_ngul: [double precision] qubit concentration in ng/ul.
18) dna_gqn: [double precision] GQN index.
19) dna_yield: [double precision] yield.
20) dna_femto_profile_description: [jsonb] Qualitative description of femto profiles.
21) tube_type: [character] Type of tube. Marked NULL or voucher.
21) dna_bnt_id: [character] Batches and Tracking legacy id.
22) extraction_type: [character] dna

NOTES: 

1) Data types were casted explicitly to conserved the data type stored in BWH.
2) To add the Fluidx ID of the original DNA extract a few filters were applied to
delete Vouchers, tubes archived because they were made in error, and invalid container names. 
4) This query follows only Benchling Data Model version 2: Results attached to the entity.
