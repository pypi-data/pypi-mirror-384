On `Binance`: now API key type [Ed25519](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/6b9a63f1e3384cf48a2eedb82767a69a) is used instead of `HMAC`

From `2.1.34` must be updated `exch_srv_cfg.toml` from `exchanges_wrapper/exch_srv_cfg.toml.template`
***

## exchanges-wrapper vs [binance.py](https://github.com/Th0rgal/binance.py)
The main difference is the development of the project for trading with many exchanges.

Next is adding a new module ```exchanges_wrapper/exch_srv.py``` as a multiplexer layer, providing simultaneous async interaction for many accounts
and many trading pairs through one connection. It's powered by [gRPC](https://grpc.io/about/)
Remote Procedure Call framework.

Warning. Coverage of overridden binance.py packages is significant but not complete.
Served methods describes into ```example/exch_client.py```

### Initial capabilities (inherited from binance.py)
- Covers general endpoints (test connectivity and get exchange information's)
- Covers market data endpoints
- Covers Account endpoints (create and manage orders)
- Covers user data stream (receive real time user updates)
- Covers web socket streams (receive real time market updates)
- Async support
- Auto reconnect after exchanges API or network failure
- Completely free and without limitations

### Added Features
- Multi exchanges support
- Adaptive algorithm to ensure maximum performance and avoid exceeding the rates limits
- Passthrough logging
- WSS keepalive
- Reuse session for new client connections
- [Utilizing Websocket API (bidirectional) for the most commonly used methods:](https://github.com/DogsTailFarmer/crypto-ws-api)

## Extra exchanges implementation features
- Binance REST API and WSS are accepted as basic, connection of other exchanges wrapped their API to Binance compatible
- For other, some data cannot be obtained by directly calling one method, it is generated by a synthetic or calculation
method
- Some exchanges have not any testing or "paper trading" features, therefore, application development and testing is possible only
at real bidding. First, run applications on the [Binance Spot Test Network](https://testnet.binance.vision/) or (Bitfinex, OKX, Bybit) test account.
