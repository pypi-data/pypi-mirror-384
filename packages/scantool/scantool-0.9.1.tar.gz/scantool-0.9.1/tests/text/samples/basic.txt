PROJECT OVERVIEW
================

This is a plain text document demonstrating the text file scanner capabilities.
It contains various structural elements that should be detected and parsed.

INTRODUCTION

The file scanner MCP is designed to handle multiple file formats including
plain text files. This document serves as a test case for the text extraction
functionality.

Features and Capabilities
-------------------------

The scanner can detect several types of structural elements in plain text:

Sections with all-caps headers are identified as major structural elements.
These help organize the document into logical parts.

Underlined headers using equals signs or dashes are also recognized as
section markers. This is a common convention in plain text documentation.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

The implementation uses pattern matching to identify:
- All-caps lines (minimum 4 characters)
- Underlined headers (= or - characters)
- Paragraph boundaries (separated by blank lines)

Each structural element is assigned precise line number ranges, making it
easy to partition files safely for processing by LLMs or other tools.

USE CASES

There are many scenarios where analyzing plain text structure is useful:

Documentation files that don't use markdown but follow text conventions
for organization. Many README files and legacy docs fall into this category.

Log files and output from various tools often use text-based headers to
separate different sections or time periods.

Configuration files sometimes use comments with special formatting to
denote different configuration blocks.

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
===========================

The text scanner is lightweight and doesn't require tree-sitter parsing.
This makes it very fast for large text files.

It handles Unicode characters gracefully and won't crash on malformed input.
The parser is designed to be robust and extract whatever structure it can
find, even in messy files.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Potential improvements could include:
- Detection of numbered lists
- Recognition of bullet points
- Indentation-based structure

Another area for development is better handling of email-style quoted text,
which often appears in documentation and discussion threads.

CONCLUSION
----------

This demonstrates the capability to extract meaningful structure from plain
text files without requiring any special markup or formatting.

The extracted structure includes line numbers for safe partitioning and
hierarchical organization when sections contain paragraphs.
