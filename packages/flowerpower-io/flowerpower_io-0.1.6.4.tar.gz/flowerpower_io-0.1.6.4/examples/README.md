# Examples

This directory contains various examples demonstrating the usage of `flowerpower-io`. These examples are designed to help you understand how to integrate and utilize the library's functionalities for different data loading and saving scenarios.

## How to Run Examples

To run these examples, ensure you have the `flowerpower-io` library installed along with any necessary dependencies for specific examples (e.g., `jupyter`, `marimo`, `pandas`, `polars`).

You can typically run Python files directly from your terminal:
```bash
python your_example.py
```

For Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter installed and run:
```bash
jupyter notebook your_example.ipynb
```

For Marimo Notebooks, you'll need to have Marimo installed and run:
```bash
marimo edit your_example.py
```

## Overview of Example Types

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
These notebooks provide interactive examples, allowing you to execute code step-by-step, visualize data, and experiment with different parameters directly within a web browser. They are ideal for exploring concepts and demonstrating workflows.

### Python Files (`.py`)
Standard Python scripts that showcase specific functionalities or end-to-end use cases. These are typically command-line executable and can be easily integrated into larger projects.

### Marimo Notebooks (`.py` with Marimo)
Marimo notebooks are reactive Python notebooks that allow you to build interactive data applications and dashboards using pure Python. They are well-suited for creating shareable, interactive examples of `flowerpower-io`'s capabilities.
