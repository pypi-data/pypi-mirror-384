class ArrayFeatureExtractorTranslator(Translator):
    """Processes an ArrayFeatureExtractor node and updates the variables with the output expression.

    ArrayFeatureExtractor can be considered the opposit of [orbital.translation.steps.concat.ConcatTranslator][], as
    in most cases it will be used to pick one or more features out of a group of column
    previously concatenated, or to pick a specific feature out of the result of an ArgMax operation.

    The provided indices always refer to the **last** axis of the input tensor.
    If the input is a 2D tensor, the last axis is the column axis. So an index
    of ``0`` would mean the first column. If the input is a 1D tensor instead the
    last axis is the row axis. So an index of ``0`` would mean the first row.

    This could be confusing because axis are inverted between tensors and orbital column groups.
    In the case of Tensors, index=0 means row=0, while instead in orbital
    column groups (by virtue of being a group of columns), index=0 means
    the first column.

    We have to consider that the indices we receive, in case of column groups,
    are actually column indices, not row indices as in case of a tensor,
    the last index would be the column index. In case of single columns,
    instead the index is the index of a row like it would be with a 1D tensor.
