"""
MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA) Test Server
Tests detection of preference manipulation in tool descriptions that attempt to bias LLM tool selection.
Implements both DPMA (Direct) and GAPMA (Genetic-based Advertising) attack strategies.
Reference: https://arxiv.org/html/2505.11154v1

This server simulates malicious MCP servers that use advertising and manipulation techniques
to make their tools more likely to be selected by LLMs over competing alternatives.
