### Path A: Standard Library Inclusion

#### Requirements for stdlib
1. **Pure Python fallback** (Required)
   - Implement pure Python version for platforms without Rust support
   - Rust version as accelerator (similar to _json vs json)
   - Ensure API compatibility between pure Python and Rust

2. **Stability guarantees**
   - API stability for 5+ years
   - Backward compatibility commitments
   - No breaking changes without deprecation cycle

3. **Security & Safety**

   - Revise PEP based on input
   - Build consensus

5. **Steering council approval** (variable)
   - Present to steering council
   - Address final concerns
   - Vote and approval

### Path B: Recommended Library Status

Alternatively, become the officially recommended validation library in Python documentation (like Requests for HTTP).

#### Requirements
1. **Excellence in documentation**
   - Tutorial-style introduction
   - Comprehensive API reference
   - Real-world examples
   - Performance guides

2. **Community consensus**
   - Wide adoption across ecosystem
   - Framework integrations
   - Industry recommendations
   - Python Software Foundation endorsement

3. **Stability and maturity**

- Propose validation syntax for Python
  ```python
  # Future Python syntax (hypothetical)
  def process_user(data: dict[str, Any]) validates User:
      # Automatic validation via Satya
      pass
  ```

🎯 **Type system integration**
- Deep integration with Python's type hints
- Collaboration with typing module maintainers

## Technical Roadmap for Integration

### Pure Python Fallback Implementation

```python
# satya/__init__.py
try:
    from ._satya import StreamValidatorCore
    _RUST_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    from ._pure_python import PythonValidatorCore as StreamValidatorCore
    _RUST_AVAILABLE = False
    import warnings
    warnings.warn(
        "Satya Rust extension not available, using pure Python fallback. "
        "Performance will be significantly reduced. "
        "Install with: pip install satya",
        ImportWarning
    )
```

### API Stability Commitment

```python
# Version 1.0.0+ guarantees:
# - No breaking changes to Model, Field, validator APIs
# - Deprecation cycle: 2 minor versions + 6 months
# - Semantic versioning strictly followed
# - LTS releases supported for 2 years
```

### Security & Safety

```toml
# Cargo.toml - Minimal unsafe code
[lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "forbid"  # Zero unsafe code in production
```

---

## Governance & Maintenance

### Proposed Governance Model

1. **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)**: Rach Pradhan
2. **Core Team**: 3-5 experienced maintainers
3. **Contributors**: Active community members
4. **Advisory Board**: Industry experts and framework authors

### Maintenance Commitments

- **Critical bugs**: Fix within 48 hours
- **Security issues**: Fix within 24 hours, coordinated disclosure
- **Minor bugs**: Fix within 2 weeks
- **Feature requests**: Evaluated quarterly
- **Releases**: Monthly minor, quarterly major

## Integration Examples

### How Satya Would Look in Python's Official Documentation

```python
# Python Tutorial - Data Validation (hypothetical)
# Using Satya for data validation

from satya import Model, Field

class User(Model):
    """Define a user schema with validation"""
    username: str = Field(min_length=3, max_length=50)
    email: str = Field(email=True)
    age: int = Field(ge=18, le=120)

# Validate data
user_data = {"username": "john", "email": "john@example.com", "age": 30}
user = User(**user_data)  # Validates automatically

# Batch validation for high performance
validator = User.validator()
results = validator.validate_batch(user_list)
```

### FastAPI Integration (Official)

```python
# FastAPI with Satya (hypothetical official support)
from fastapi import FastAPI
from satya import Model, Field

app = FastAPI(validation_library="satya")  # Use Satya instead of Pydantic

class Item(Model):
    name: str
    price: float = Field(gt=0)

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    # Validated by Satya at 4.2M items/sec!
    return item
```

## Challenges & Mitigation

### Challenge 1: Rust Dependency
**Issue**: Not all platforms support Rust compilation  
**Mitigation**: Pure Python fallback implementation

### Challenge 2: API Changes
**Issue**: Current API might need changes for stdlib  
**Mitigation**: Design API with stdlib in mind, minimize changes

### Challenge 3: Competition
**Issue**: Pydantic is well-established  
**Mitigation**: Offer superior performance, compatibility mode

### Challenge 4: Maintenance Burden
**Issue**: stdlib inclusion requires long-term commitment  
**Mitigation**: Build strong maintainer team, clear governance

### Challenge 5: Community Resistance
**Issue**: "Another validation library?"  
**Mitigation**: Prove value through performance, interoperability
