# Aria Gen2: Project Aria Client SDK For Python

ClientSDK is a comprehensive toolbox designed to facilitate control and interaction with Aria Gen2 devices. It is part of the Aria Research Kit and provides a set of libraries, utilities, and example code to streamline device management, authentication, recording, and streaming.

## Key Features

* **Device Management**: Core classes and utilities for connecting to, authenticating, and controlling Aria Gen2 devices
* **Streaming Support**: Components for starting and managing data streams, including on-device machine perception data (VIO, hand pose, and eye gaze) and other sensor data
* **Recording Support**: Components for starting and managing recording on-device
* **Security**: Built-in support for streaming certificates and security options
* **Python & CLI Tools**: Includes Python SDK and command-line utilities for scripting and automation
* **Example Code**: Ready-to-use examples to help developers get started quickly

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure you have:

* **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04
* **Python**: Version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
* **Hardware**: Aria Gen2 device
* **Mobile App**: Aria Companion App (installed and paired with your device)
* **Connection**: USB cable for device-to-PC connection

# Aria Gen1: Project Aria Client SDK For Python

The Project Aria Client SDK with CLI provides robust capabilities for creating computer
vision and machine learning applications with the Project Aria glasses.

The Client SDK currently offers the ability to:
- Connect and disconnect from the device via USB and WiFi
- Retrieve detailed device information and its current status
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities
- Access calibration data for the sensors you're recording with
- Subscribe and listen to Aria sensors data
- Visualize streaming data

A CLI is installed as part of the SDK, which provides the ability to:
- Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 - 3.11
- Platform: Mac Big Sur+, Fedora 36+, Ubuntu 22.04+
- A router such as Asus, Netgear or TP-Link with no firewall that supports Wi-Fi
  6 to connect the glasses to the 5GHz band for when streaming over Wi-Fi
- Update your glasses to the latest OS using the Aria Mobile Companion App
