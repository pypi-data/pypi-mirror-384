              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# AYON server API
Python client for connection server. The client is using REST and GraphQl to communicate with server with `requests` module.

AYON Python api should support connection to server with raw REST functions and prepared functionality for work with entities. Must not contain only functionality that can be used with core server functionality.

Module support singleton connection which is using `AYON_SERVER_URL` and `AYON_API_KEY` environment variables as source for connection. The singleton connection is using `ServerAPI` object. There can be created multiple connection to different server at one time, for that purpose use `ServerAPIBase` object.

## Install
AYON python api is available on PyPi:

    pip install ayon-python-api

For development purposes you may follow [build](#build-wheel) guide to build and install custom wheels.


## Cloning the repository
Repository does not have submodules or special cases. Clone is simple as:

    git clone git@github.com:ynput/ayon-python-api.git


## Build wheel
For wheel build is required a `wheel` module from PyPi:

    pip install wheel

Open terminal and change directory to ayon-python-api repository and build wheel:

    cd <REPOSITORY ROOT>/ayon-python-api
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel   
    

Once finished a wheel should be created in `./dist/ayon_python_api-<VERSION>-py3-none-any`.

---

### Wheel installation
The wheel file can be used to install using pip:

    pip install <REPOSITORY ROOT>/dist/ayon_python_api-<VERSION>-py3-none-any

If pip complain that `ayon-python-api` is already installed just uninstall existing one first:
    
    pip uninstall ayon-python-api


## TODOs
- Find more suitable name of `ServerAPI` objects (right now is used `con` or `connection`)
- Add all available CRUD operation on entities using REST
- Add folder and task changes to operations
- Enhance entity hub
  - Missing docstrings in EntityHub -> especially entity arguments are missing
  - Better order of arguments for entity classes
    - Move entity hub to first place
    - Skip those which are invalid for the entity and fake it for base or remove it from base
  - Entity hub should use operations session to do changes
  - Entity hub could also handle 'product', 'version' and 'representation' entities
  - Missing 'status' on folders
  - Missing assignees on tasks
  - Pass docstrings and arguments definitions from `ServerAPI` methods to global functions
- Split `ServerAPI` into smaller chunks (somehow), the class has 4k+ lines of code
- Add .pyi stub for ServerAPI 
- Missing websockets connection
