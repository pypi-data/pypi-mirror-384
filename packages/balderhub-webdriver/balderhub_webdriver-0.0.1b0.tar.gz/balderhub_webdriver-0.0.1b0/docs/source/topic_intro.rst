Introduction into Browser Automation/WebDriver
**********************************************

Browser automation tools automate web interactions like clicking and form filling, mainly for testing and scraping.

This BalderHub project offers a common interface to simplifying the using of these tools. It provides an unified
interface, allowing testers to integrate browser automation tools in Balder environments without writing own selenium,
playwright or appium specific code.

Introduction to Browser Automation Tools
========================================

Browser automation tools are software that simulate user actions on web browsers, such as clicking buttons or filling
forms. They are essential for tasks like automated testing to ensure web apps work across browsers and web scraping to
extract data efficiently.


Specific implemented BalderHub projects
---------------------------------------

Currently we only have selenium as supported implementation of this package. `PlayWright <https://playwright.dev/>` and
`Appium <https://appium.io/>` are under development and will be released soon. Please find more information about that
in the documentation of `the balderhub-selenium package <https://hub.balder.dev/projects/selenium>`_.
